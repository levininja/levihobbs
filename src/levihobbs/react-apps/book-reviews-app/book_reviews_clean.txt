However, it worked for me as a kind of way to have a "remix" of the original book, an alternate way of experiencing it if you've already experienced it. The production quality was top notch with great sound effects and voicing. Hearing the whistling of the wind alone was enough to add substantially to the empty feeling of this book.

I don't want to go this long between readings next time.  From the moment I started reading the prologue, this was so good. It's so refreshing after the years of reading many other things, many of which are mediocre, some downright bad, to come back to something I know is amazing. Right from the moment that I started reading Tolkien's forward on details about hobbits, their three races, etc, I knew I was home.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Tolkien is his voice. It's grandfatherly, very positive, very reassuring. Another thing, of course, is his worldbuilding. The languages you're exposed to, the poems (which are actually good, unlike most fantasy authors who have tried to pull this off), the appendices...in no other text have I enjoyed reading appendices so much. And the historical footnotes, wow. Those really give it a level of verisimilitude that is really endearing.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note, now that I've seen the movies a billion times, all of the differences between the movies and the books. I actually thought there were some ways in which the movies were a little better--blasphemy, I know. But in some places they just did better at increasing the sense of tension before release. Of course, the main area in which they are lacking is the full world, that feeling, as well as the almost relaxed at one-ness with nature that you can only get when reading a book; movies have to have a certain pace. It's hard to put into words what I mean there, but...you just have to read it to understand.<br/><br/>There's also the whole scouring and restoration of the shire at the end, which is highly satisfying--pity the movies didn't have time to do that. And Tom Bombadil. And Denethor has more nuance and wisdom in the books. And the death of Théoden is more properly grieved and dramatized. And there's the romance between Faramir and Éowyn which is really a fascinating dynamic. Her character is much better explored in the books. And I feel that Boromir gets a better treatment in the books as well. And you get Shelob's little epic backstory. And you get a better glimpse into the orcs' worlds, which I highly enjoyed.<br/><br/>If you haven't read this, read it. There is so much there that you haven't gotten through the movies. It's an experience. And you really especially don't want to miss getting to know Tolkien's voice. I feel like I know him and love him even though I've never met the man. I wish I could have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | the lord of the rings j.r.r. tolkien houghton mifflin harcourt favorites featured                                                   | t                |

The Big Book is powerful, but it was written while the founders of AA were still trying to get sober and it would be hard to argue that it has no flaws. The 12x12, on the other hand, I have found to be very thorough on every step and provide deep insights on each one.

 1995 | 1984                                                                        | George          | Orwell         |        5 |          4.20 |           298 |                         | 2025-06-18 14:55:39.302708-07 | An unforgettable classic of the dystopian genre, it's still unparalleled in its deep satire of totalitarian states and their systems of propaganda, by which they change the language itself to the point of absurdity, where everything's true meaning is the opposite of its name: the Ministry of Love is where you go to get tortured; the Ministry of Truth is where they fabricate lies (propaganda); and so forth. These patterns have been played out the world over, again and again, in so many countries and political parties.<br/><br/>I used to think that between 1984 and Brave New World, that the later got things more right because a system built on drugging your population by appealing to their happiness (as opposed to their fear) is more self-sustaining. Today, I look at the long-lasting examples in the real world of both and think, it looks like either one can be self-sustaining.If anything, this story is sad and scary because certain places (China and North Korea for instance) are so ridiculously dystopian today that, well...I really wish this book were just fiction, because of all of the very real people who have to live in these regimes.<br/><br/>To the degree that a country or political party mimics the ones in this book is the degree to which they should not be taken seriously in one sense--in that they should have zero credibility--but they should be taken very seriously in another sense--in that they know what they are doing and are a serious threat to the free world. Cults also follow this same pattern of mind control.<br/><br/>This book is also striking for calling out the war culture, where a dystopian government needs and wants continual war because the fear and extreme patriotism and brain-washing all go together so well.<br/><br/>The book is also just very well-written, very easy to read, hard to put down, even as it takes you down a dark path, you are drawn to keep reading it, drawn to the "horror" of it, for lack of a better word.<br/><br/>George Orwell is also just such a great man for inventing so many new words: Big Brother, doublespeak, newspeak, crimethink, unperson. What a great man for giving us words and imagery to convey just what it is that we see and fear our governments becoming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1984 george orwell houghton mifflin harcourt                                                                                        | t                |             
 1983 | Tenth of December                                                           | George          | Saunders       |        5 |          3.98 |           251 |                    2013 | 2025-06-18 14:55:39.300035-07 | Tenth of December is my favorite short story collection, or tied for favorite with Flanner O'Connor's Complete Short Stories, if I'm allowed to cheat. The two collections couldn't have settings that are more different...Saunders' stories have modern settings and sometimes mix in mysterious science fiction, and he has a fetish for bizarre amusement parks. O'Connor, on the other hand, wrote gothic (creepy, horror-esque) stories about Southern people in the 50s.<br/><br/>And yet they both do the same thing really well, which I love: deep characterization. They both dance between the line of stream-of-consciousness and not. There are lots of inner thoughts, but blessedly, they are significantly more comprehensible than, say, Virginia Woolf or William Faulkner, the true stream-of-consciousness writers who throw you into a brain storm of thoughts devoid of context. Those feel like too much work for me to completely enjoy, although I respect them.<br/><br/>Saunders is my favorite living author. His combination of wit, weird humor, strange themes, and just...I don't know how to explain it, but he really knows how to write a short story. They are always very evocative and stick with me, and yet he never really gives you a solid definite moral to the story or even a definite theme.<br/><br/>I still don't know what themes Saunders was trying to get across to me and actually, I think that's a good thing, because that way it doesn't get in the way of the art, and allows me to read my own themes into it. I don't know what themes he had in mind not because he didn't have themes in mind, but because he writes in such a way that the stories and art come first, and he kind of gets himself "out of the way" of the story.<br/><br/>His prose is beautiful and stark at the same time. He does things that frankly I have no idea how he pulls off. His stories have darker elements and yet there is an element of hope that keeps them from just being purely bleak. In one particular story, I was struck with the fact that somehow, I felt quite hopeful at the end even though it ends with the protagonist dying. How did he do that?<br/><br/>This is one of the few books I have read multiple times. It has inspired me to read some of his other fiction: Lincoln in the Bardo and Liberation Day. Unfortunately, neither of those hit the high bar that Tenth of December hit for me; but you can read my reviews of those if you're curious for more detail.<br/><br/>One of his stories, Sticks, is only a page long. And it's one of the best flash fiction stories I have ever read; it has to do with the different ways that a group of adult sibilings react to the death of their father. There is a particular line I think about a lot, when he says that his father's "one concession to glee" was this pole that he would decorate with some ridiculous arnamentation, some kind of human-esque parody to represent the current season.<br/><br/>Anyways, this book is so full of paradoxical strengths. And he manages to write about so many different people in different stages and walks of life and be totally convincing. The first story, Victory Lap, has a teenage girl voice that for once is believable and yet not tropey.

Read a couple pages and get a few laughs in, but don’t read the whole thing in one sitting or it will get old; also you’ll lose feeling in your legs and have that awful pins and needles effect when you stand up.

Still one of my favorite fantasy novels.

 1927 | Final Eclipse                                                               | Matthew         | Huddleston     |        5 |          5.00 |           292 |                         | 2025-06-18 14:55:39.266458-07 | It is so rare to read science fiction these days that both inspires the imagination and also teaches real science. <br/><br/>This last week I reviewed Three Body Problem, which I raved about because it does just that. Final Eclipse is another of the few. It has a small group of friends using deduction and science to battle against a conspiracy of unseen, sinister extraterrestrials who are hell-bent on conquering the planet.<br/><br/>And best of all (for a worldbuilding sucker like me), along the way you get to learn a lot about physics, history, and a smattering of so many others, from astronomy to sea ice to SOFAR to intriguing military technologies to why Iceland would be the best place on Earth to survive a winter apocalypse.<br/><br/>In addition to all that, this is also a very special book to me personally.<br/><br/>You see, about 6 years ago, I started a writer’s group that meets at me and my wife’s home. We set out to do one thing really well together: to give high quality constructive feedback regularly that manages to be both highly rigorous and uplifting.<br/><br/>Of the writers in that group, we’ve covered a lot of ground together over the years. We’ve struggled together to figure out so many things, encouraged each other in the lows, celebrated together in the highs.<br/>And several novels have gone through our group. But today, the first one is getting published.<br/><br/>I couldn’t be more proud, because, as much as this book is definitely the brain-child of Matthew, it also feels a little bit like the child of the whole writer’s group, the proverbial village that it takes to raise a child. It’s Matthew’s biological child, but we all got to participate in a really substantive way, and that’s just really cool.<br/><br/>I often call Matthew the world’s most fascinating man. He’s a physics professor, a world traveler, an astronomer, a voracious reader of science fiction and many other genres, and he’s always taking some absolutely epic trip somewhere, kayaking down a river in the Congo to be the first one to film a remote waterfall, or traveling to the Azores Islands to do research for his book, or to Iceland to do research for his book, or…did I mention this guy does some incredible research for his books? Who does that???<br/><br/>He’s also just one of those people who are a seemingly infinite treasure trove of interesting information. And a gifted teacher. I’ve seen him teach complex physics topics to a mixed audience on the spot with ease.<br/><br/>Okay wow, I’ve gone far afield from talking about the book. The book!<br/><br/>Final Eclipse is epic. The first part is brooding. Our heroes and heroine become privy to the fact that the world as we know it is about to end. But almost no one on the planet knows it yet. People are just going about their days, few of them—outside a small handful of scientists—aware that there’s any problem at all. But there is, and it’s sinister.<br/><br/>Kevin’s father is a top scientist at an agency that monitors satellites. Particular satellites: the ones that monitor the sun. And then one day, all of these satellites mysteriously go dead within a moment of each other.<br/><br/>What could it be? Equipment malfunction? Solar flare? They test out the standard list of theories, but nothing checks out. Until someone comes up with a strange theory.<br/><br/>You see, all of these satellites are at a very special location in space. If you’re monitoring the sun, the best place to put your satellites is a location called L1. It’s one of the LaGrange points: particular spots around the Earth wherein, if you put a satellite, the forces of gravity all equal out so that it will stay put indefinitely without you having to expend any energy to keep it there. The L1 point is the place partway in a line between the sun and Earth, at just the spot where the gravity of Earth and the gravity of the sun equal out, pulling in two exact opposite directions (obviously much closer to the Earth than the sun to compensate for the fact that the sun is 300,000 times heavier).<br/><br/>Anyways, what’s such a big deal about this LaGrange point? Well if you think about it, if you wanted to put something between those two bodies…indefinitely…such as, I don’t know, a huge shield to block all sunlight from getting to the Earth…voila.<br/><br/>Someone’s out to kill all life on the planet.<br/><br/>The plot progresses along several lines. Without giving too much away, I’ll just say that this is about good old fashioned fighting against the alien invaders, plus there’s the pandemonium of the masses preparing for impending doom, there’s the malice of nations against one another, there’s militaries and nations and a bit of politics, but most importantly, there’s the mystery unraveling slowly of figuring out: who exactly are these aliens? What kind of people would attack the earth in this way? How can we prepare for them? More is continually revealed as we adventure all over the globe, and it’s quite satisfying.<br/><br/>Oh and one other thing. Far from reading like a textbook, this is pretty easy reading. In fact, one of the other writers in our group described it as “YA (young adult) for grown-ups,” and I have to agree.<br/><br/>It’s fun, but not stupid. I’ve read my fair share of bad YA. One of the classic YA pitfalls is to make it seem like for some reason, it’s just the kids who are capable of doing anything to save the world, and all the adults are idiots…pure wish fulfillment. But this book is refreshing because it doesn’t do that. The adults are doing the big plans and everything—much more realistic—but at the same time, our young heroes and heroine have a major part to play, and we get to see the world through their eyes. And it’s just a lot more fun that way. I feel like I’m getting the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>Okay, if I talk any more about this book I’m going to give things away. Go out and read it today! It’s a fun ride. | final eclipse matthew huddleston archway publishing                                                                                 | t                |             
 1882 | The Odyssey                                                                 | Homer           | Homer          |        4 |          3.82 |           541 |                         | 2025-06-18 14:55:39.253796-07 | I read Samuel Butler's translation, originally published in 1900, which is recommended if you're looking for a prose translation that retains some of the poetic language. I considered the older language that Butler uses to be fitting to me for reading something this ancient.<br/><br/>One of the fascinating things about Samuel Butler's translation is that it includes a preface, written by him, where he explains that he had published a book called "The Authoress of the Odyssey" in which he claimed that the author of the Odyssey was not in fact Homer (which wasn't so provocative an idea at the time), but was in fact a woman (which was).<br/><br/>Further, he goes on to speculate who the woman was and name a particular woman; he thinks she must have written herself into the story.<br/><br/>I did a little research on his claims, and it seems that scholars are open to the idea that the Odyssey could have in fact been written by a woman. The claims of who that particular woman was are pretty far-reaching, but the idea that it was probably not Homer isn't a stretch at all; there's evidence that it was probably composed hundreds of years after The Iliad.<br/><br/>Butler’s theory stuck with me as I read, especially because The Odyssey is so full of domestic detail: food preparation, garments, household routines. There's a quiet authority in those passages, a specificity that feels lived rather than imagined.<br/><br/>As someone who has spent a lot of time with other writers in critique groups, I’ve come to believe that those unassuming little details—the subconscious ones, the things the author didn’t think were important—are the best glimpses into the real person behind the pen. Anyone can write about war or love or loss, but the mundane details are harder to fake. They suggest proximity.<br/><br/>The structure of the story surprised me. Having read an abridged version as a kid, I expected most of the book to focus on Odysseus's island-hopping adventures. Instead, the majority centers on the suitors plot—Odysseus's wife dealing with persistent suitors while he's away, and his eventual return in disguise to deal with them. This storyline dominates the narrative, often feeling static as characters wait around talking while nothing happens. Meanwhile, some of Odysseus's most fascinating adventures get condensed to single paragraphs, which was frustrating.<br/><br/>Despite this structural imbalance, the book delivers moments of genuine power. Butler's translation captures beautiful poetic language throughout, and certain scenes have stayed with me long after reading. Achilles' haunting words from the underworld—"I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead"—perfectly encapsulate the Greek view of mortality that made The Iliad so compelling.<br/><br/>The scene with Argos, Odysseus's loyal dog, might be one of the most emotionally effective passages in all of ancient literature. The image of this neglected hound, "full of fleas" and lying "on the heaps of mule and cow dung," who still recognizes his master after twenty years and dies as soon as he sees him, is heartbreaking in its simplicity.<br/><br/>There's also Odysseus's warning to Amphinomus about human vanity and the fickleness of fortune: "Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter." These philosophical moments elevate the narrative beyond mere adventure story.<br/><br/>The psychological complexity shows through in scenes like Odysseus describing his own clothing to his disguised wife in elaborate detail—the purple wool mantle with its gold brooch showing "a dog holding a spotted fawn between his forepaws." It's both touching and slightly absurd, this moment of vanity from a hero in disguise.<br/><br/>Theoclymenus's prophetic vision near the end provides genuine chills: "The air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drop blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell." Butler's translation makes this supernatural moment feel appropriately ominous.<br/><br/>The Odyssey is a foundational work that rewards careful reading. Butler's translation, despite being over a century old, felt authentic to the ancient world, although admittedly I haven't compared it to other translations. The domestic details, the psychological complexity, and those moments of startling beauty make this worth the read.<br/><br/>By the way, when I read the story about Argos the Dog, I felt my heart was yanked about. We're given this sweet moment, but then suddenly the dog dies. Just like that, mentioned in an offhand manner. I thought to myself: "what if a story were written from Argos' perspective that was more satisfying? What about a story where it actually makes sense that he dies at the end and it gives you a sense of the story being complete instead of incomplete?" So I set out to do just that.
