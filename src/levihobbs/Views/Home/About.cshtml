    <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
    <p>I've always lived at the intersection of logic and imagination. By day, I am a software developer with a focus on building clean, functional digital spaces. By night (and early morning), I am a writer of science fiction and fantasy, currently deep in the world of The Broken Universe.</p>
    <p>After moving from Tennessee to a log cabin on 10 acres in Chattaroy, Washington, I realized that the best work happens when we have the space to breathe. That's why I founded The Wildflower Retreat—a place designed specifically for writers to escape the noise and find their flow.</p>

    <h2>Why I Build for Authors</h2>
    <p>As both a developer and an author, I know that a writer's website is more than just a digital business card; it's the gateway to your world. I specialize in creating author platforms that are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Story-First:</strong> Designed to highlight your bibliography and brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Technically Robust:</strong> Built with the same precision I use in professional AI training and software engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Easy for you to manage so you can get back to writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Life Outside the Screen</h2>
    <p>When I'm not coding or world-building, you'll usually find me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring the Inland Northwest in my RV with my wife, Gretchen, and our two dogs, Champ and Sophie.</li>
        <li>Tending to my garden or pressing flowers from the property.</li>
        <li>At the table for a board game night (usually a roll-and-write or a round of Bananagrams).</li>
        <li>Working on the next DIY project around the cabin.</li>
    </ul>
