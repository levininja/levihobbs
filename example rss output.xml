        I read Samuel Butler's translation, originally published in 1900, which is recommended if you're looking for a prose translation that retains some of the poetic language but without actually going for a poetry translation approach. I considered the older language that Butler uses to be a feature, not a bug, since it felt more fitting to me for reading something this ancient. Overly modern translations of ancient classics can grate on me.<br /><br />One of the fascinating things about Samuel Butler's translation is that it includes a preface, written by him, where he explains that he had published a book called "The Authoress of the Odyssey" in which he claimed that the author of the Odyssey was not in fact Homer (which wasn't so provocative an idea at the time), but was in fact a woman (which was). Further, he goes on to speculate who the woman was and name a particular woman based only on the fact that she shows up in the text and he feels she must have written herself into the story.<br /><br />I did a little research on his claims, and it seems that scholars are open to the idea that the Odyssey could have in fact been written by a woman. The claims of who that particular woman was are pretty far-reaching, but the idea that it was probably not Homer isn't a stretch at all; there's evidence that it was probably composed hundreds of years after The Iliad.<br /><br />Butler’s theory stuck with me as I read, especially because The Odyssey is so full of domestic detail: food preparation, garments, household routines. There's a quiet authority in those passages, a specificity that feels lived rather than imagined. As someone who reads and works with writers, I’ve come to believe that those unassuming little details—the subconscious ones, the things the author didn’t think were important—are the best glimpses into the real person behind the pen. Anyone can write about war or love or loss, but the mundane details are harder to fake. They suggest proximity.<br /><br />The structure of the story surprised me. Having read an abridged version as a kid, I expected most of the book to focus on Odysseus's island-hopping adventures. Instead, the majority centers on the suitors plot—Odysseus's wife dealing with persistent suitors while he's away, and his eventual return in disguise to deal with them. This storyline dominates the narrative, often feeling static as characters wait around talking while nothing happens. Meanwhile, some of Odysseus's most fascinating adventures get condensed to single paragraphs, which was frustrating.<br />Despite this structural imbalance, the book delivers moments of genuine power. Butler's translation captures beautiful poetic language throughout, and certain scenes have stayed with me long after reading. Achilles' haunting words from the underworld—"I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead"—perfectly encapsulate the Greek view of mortality that made The Iliad so compelling.<br /><br />The scene with Argos, Odysseus's loyal dog, might be one of the most emotionally effective passages in all of ancient literature. The image of this neglected hound, "full of fleas" and lying "on the heaps of mule and cow dung," who still recognizes his master after twenty years and dies as soon as he sees him, is heartbreaking in its simplicity.<br /><br />There's also Odysseus's warning to Amphinomus about human vanity and the fickleness of fortune: "Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter." These philosophical moments elevate the narrative beyond mere adventure story.<br /><br />The psychological complexity shows through in scenes like Odysseus describing his own clothing to his disguised wife in elaborate detail—the purple wool mantle with its gold brooch showing "a dog holding a spotted fawn between his forepaws." It's both touching and slightly absurd, this moment of vanity from a hero in disguise.<br />Theoclymenus's prophetic vision near the end provides genuine chills: "The air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drop blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell." Butler's translation makes this supernatural moment feel appropriately ominous.<br /><br />The Odyssey is a foundational work that rewards careful reading. Butler's translation, despite being over a century old, felt authentic to the ancient world, although admittedly I haven't compared it to other translations. The domestic details, the psychological complexity, and those moments of startling beauty make this worth the read.<br /><br />By the way, when I read the story about Argos the Dog, I felt my heart was yanked about. We're given this sweet moment, but then suddenly the dog dies. Just like that, mentioned in an offhand manner. I thought to myself: "what if a story were written from Argos' perspective that was more satisfying? What about a story where it actually makes sense that he dies at the end and it gives you a sense of the story being complete instead of incomplete?" So I set out to do just that. If you're interested in reading it, here's my attempt at Odyssey fan fiction:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://levihobbs.substack.com/p/argos-the-dog" rel="nofollow noopener">https://levihobbs.substack.com/p/argo...</a><br />

        This review will mostly ignore the fact that the author is my father and discuss it on an objective basis (at least, as far as such things can be done), but I'll have a few personal comments at the end.<br /><br />Overview<br />This is a book in the realm of epistemology, the realm of philosophy concerned with how we know things and what can be justified as a rational belief.<br /><br />The main thesis of the book is that, while the philosophical literature on epistemology normally presents religion as ideological and of no explanatory value, and science is depicted as the gold standard of explanation, the reality is that the name of science is often invoked in epistemological arguments that are in fact ideological in basis, and furthermore, that there can be such a thing as rational religious explanations. The latter point is the main thesis of the book, and I'll come back to that.<br /><br />One important term: explanations that include a positing of the existence of God are used interchangeably with "religious explanations," which I think he used as a shorthand for the former.<br /><br />A Working Definition for God<br />I found his definition of God for the purposes of this philosophical exercise to be interesting.<br />"It seems necessary to restrict our discussion of God to entities satisfying five conditions:<br />* immateriality<br />* intelligence<br />* ability to act<br />* creator of the world<br />* worthiness for worship.<br />If no entity satisfies all of these, then there is no God."<br /><br />As I pondered the usefulness of this set of five criteria, I thought to myself that I could reduce it to three:<br />* immateriality<br />* creator of the world<br />* worthiness for worship<br />Because after all, if God is creator of the world (read: universe), then it implies a being of so much power that this being would be essentially, by our reckoning, of nearly infinite power, simply based on that fact alone. It is probably logically inconsistent to claim that a being could be powerful enough to create the universe and yet be unable to act or not be intelligent.<br /><br />This list is similar to the list I had constructed several years ago for myself. It seems to me that for a being to qualify as "God," it must at a minimum:<br />* be beyond measurement (essentially the same as immateriality)<br />* be all powerful (which, creator of the world is basically tantamount to that).<br /><br />Conspicuously absent was the "worthiness of worship" part, but I think it was something I simply took for granted and didn't think to list. I was more thinking of the qualities of God intrinsic to him, rather than any conclusions about how humans should respond to him, which this trait seems to fall under the category of.<br /><br />Religious Explanations<br />Anyways. This book is primarily about religious explanations, which is a controversial idea sure to meet resistance both from scientific and religious authorities. But I think he makes an excellent argument for them.<br /><br />First of all, while truly scientific explanations are splendid, there are many domains which by their very nature intrinsically preclude the ability to furnish explanations that meet all of the value criteria of science, but may still meet some of the criteria. He upholds the scientific values of clarity, consistency, and evidential support as being of universal value in any domain, while challenging that others (control, replicability, and prediction) should be required in nonscientific domains.<br /><br />He aims to "reconstruct from religious contexts a system of cognitive values with broad application that takes exception to a number of scientific norms. These norms pertain to:<br />1. the ranking of outstanding problem areas in importance<br />2. the usefulness of anecdotal material<br />3. the status of teleological explanations<br />4. the degree to which pragmatic considerations govern theorizing<br />5. standards for explanations in nonscientific areas."<br /><br />Anecdotal Evidence<br />He spends especial time on criteria 2, because he finds that anecdotal evidence is vital to revealed theology and is chronically undervalued in a dogmatic, ideological way. He argues that scientists are used to rejecting anecdotal evidence out-of-hand probably because they are used to being able to furnish higher-quality evidence, which of course is only right. However in the religious domain, anecdotal evidence is key, and furthermore is often the best type of evidence for different phenomenoa. <br /><br />Furthermore, the idea that anecdotal evidence has no epistemological value in the realm of science is simply not true. Most theories that are now widely accepted were, at first, hypotheses that were only founded on anecdotal evidence. Because a scientist noticed how often the anecdotal evidence came up and formed a theory and went about testing it, we have wonderful scientific discoveries.<br /><br />He gives first the example of the green flash at sunset phenomenon, which was for many years ridiculed by scientists as being made up by sailors but since then has been confirmed. He then gives another example of a phenomenon that is still in the realm of anecdotal evidence but which most scientists at this point believe must be real despite the lack of reproducibility: ball lightning. If you’re not familiar with that particular phenomenon I highly recommend reading the Wikipedia article.<br /><br />I'm getting long-winded, so I'll focus on wrapping up the last three chapters of the book.<br /><br />Ideological Aspects of Science<br />The next chapter is devoted to exploring ideological aspects of science--or rather by "science", he means the culture in which science is practiced. He points out that the world in which science is practiced is, in fact, a particular subculture, with its own set of cultural values and biases inherent to it. He then goes on to give a stab as to a proposed list of those values and even puts them into a table and categorizes them, which I found helpful and ambitious. It's a topic that personally fascinates me: in what ways is "science" carried out with biases and ideologies? <br /><br />He explores the answers to that question in a rather satisfying way. He groups values together according to which ones are truly essential to the actual scientific method and which ones are more just values which have no epistemological value, and the enforcement of these values on science (and even more so on realms outside of science) is not rational but ideological.<br /><br />He also explores exactly why it is that religious and scientific people so often are in conflict: it's a question of values. Very few of their values overlap and most are in conflict.<br /><br />Near Death Experiences (NDEs)<br />The next chapter takes an interesting turn. He assesses near-death experiences (NDEs). The reason why was not readily obvious to me, but it soon became apparent why. He strikes a parallel between the ball lightning example given earlier and NDEs. Both are examples of an area where, based on the preponderance of anecdotal evidence that actually is rather consistent in the things it reports, there is great reason to ascribe rational justification to believing that these things are real phenomena and not merely made up or psychological phenomena. Ball lightning is the example of one such area that most scientists (physicists, particularly) have actually begrudingly acknowledged must be real despite it not being reproducible (yet). NDEs is the example of one such area that has not been yet (as of the writing of his book) been readily accepted by the scientific community as real, but he believes that it would in fact be rationally justified in believing that these are real phenomena.<br /><br />Why? Well, the answer is fascinating. NDEs sound cooky, but this book lays out a very excellent arguments that they do have some correspondence to reality. First though, some background information is essential.<br /><br />First, NDEs have increased greatly in occurrence since the 70s because of medical techniques in reviving people after death becoming widespread (CPR, defibrillators, etc.). (And we are talking about people who literally died; the heart was not beating.) It turns out that a large percentage of people who die and come back (I think it was 10 or 20%) experience NDEs. They experience them in different cultures and they report remarkably consistent things despite many of them reporting in interviews that they had never consumed any literature or other media around NDEs before and had no knowledge of other NDE stories.<br /><br />Second, there are two basic types of NDEs. One he dubs the transcental type: people report going to Heaven, Hell, or having mystical experiences, perhaps a tunnel of light, and receiving divine revelations. Naturally, none of this information is verifiable.<br /><br />But the other major type of NDE is the naturalistic type: people report floating above the room, usually at about ceiling height, looking down, and observing things that were happening in the hospital room when they were supposedly unconscious. Not only that, but they report (after resuscitation) very specific things that were said and done to the medical personnel who are astounded because of the fact that those things did in fact happen.<br /><br />Surely those were just flukes, right? Tall tales? Here's where it gets even better. Michael Sabom was a skeptic who set out to investigate these reported NDEs. He was uniquely positioned as a cardiologist who would be in the room when people would be brought back after death and these experiences would inevitably be reported. So he went about setting up an experiment to test for whether these experiences were real. He had a control group of patients and quizzed them and the NDE-reporters about basics of the cardiac procedures that were done on them. The NDE people were in fact able to report details of the procedure that they would have no business knowing with much greater accuracy than the control group. They were in fact observing things that happened in the room when they were supposedly unconscious and dead.<br /><br />This single fact has become reality-altering to me and endlessly fascinating. Why is this not discussed more? Probably because of all the biases against NDEs that are based on the spiritual/religious aspect of the reports and the ideological stances against religious persons. Almost all people who have an NDE go on to become more spiritual and religious, and in fact, for those who attempted to commit suicide, none of them (none!) ever attempts suicide a second time, which is quite astounding considering that for the rest of the population who attempt suicide, the likelihood they will attempt again is quite high.<br /><br />I could go on about this but suffice it to say, this is an area I must research further. Obviously the fact that NDEs of the naturalistic type are real then implies that the transcendental ones also have some form of correspondence to truth. This is really fascinating.<br /><br />Constructing Religious Explanations<br />The final chapter is on constructing religious explanations. It builds on all previous chapters to make the point that rationally justifiable explanations could (in certain circumstances) be constructed that involve, as a part of the explanation, the existence of a God. He then talks about modeling what could be said about that God that would be true based on the evidence we have. <br /><br />But, as he points out, there are so many problems with us trying to assign intentionality to a God based on the things we can observe about the world. First there's a problem of a being of lesser intelligence trying to analyze a being of considerably greater intelligence. Second, there are all of the biases we have in trying to interpret God. We inevitably come up with analogies for God, but all of these usually have huge value-based biases baked into them. Are there ways in which God is like a father, for instance? Perhaps, but doesn't that view anthropomorphize God and might it not lead to considerable errors and biases?<br /><br />He also talks briefly about the analogy of God being like the Wizard of Oz and another analogy of God being a provider and a fundamental paradox in that (related to the problem of evil). He then talks about modeling God as having multiple personalities and finally, explores a nascence archetype: ways in which perhaps God is like a child. This last part was a bit of a stretch for me and I felt needed to be explicated more in order to be more coherent.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book gives one the impression that we haven't really gotten anywhere at all; one gest the idea that he wasn't really sure where to go from there himself. That experience can overshadow the fact that the rest of the book did cover some very good ground. Frankly, if he was alive I would recommend to him to rewrite the book with a new ending chapter, because I think it does the rest of the book a disservice. There is a lot of good ground covered in all the preceding chapters.<br /><br />A Personal Note<br />A note about my father. He had a doctorate in philosophy and this book was a summary of many of his interests coming together; I think it built on what he had written in his dissertation and expanded it. He was an odd man, far on the spectrum, mystical in his experiences of God, smarter than anyone I've ever met in the sense of analytic intelligence, dumber than almost anyone I've ever met in terms of understanding people. He married very late in life (37) and was divorced 13 years later. He lived a strange life full of adventures and living on pennies except towards the last third of his life when he got into actuarial science as a means of providing for his family. He had a fetish for growing home-grown corn and tomatoes, and he loved to play classical music on his upright piano. He died doing something he loved, which was bicycling on the country roads of Rutherford County, Tennessee. He had a PhD in philosophy and a master's in mathematics. He summited mountains, bicycled across the country twice, and traveled the world. He died alone.<br /><br />I myself am an amateur student of philosophy, an interest that has grown considerably in recent years. I've read only a handful of modern philosophy books and was impressed with the lucidity that this particular book had (or rather, I was pleased that I was able to understand most of it). Suffice it to say that most of the works of philosophy that I have read so far are very old and this book was one of only a few exceptions.<br /><br />My interests in philosophy are largely in the epistemic vein and I am essentially an empiricist at current time. I believe in truth as correspondence and am searching for it constantly in all realms of life, and I also have a mystical experience of God and personal experiences that I believe make me rationally justified in believing in his existence. I'm particularly interested in scientific thinking but also see the flaws with how it is often applied (or rather misapplied). Basically, this book hit all the right notes for me.<br /><br />I was really surprised at the fact that my father had never discussed some of the major topics in this book with me. Based on the major topics of this book, one would expect that he had told me before about NDEs, the ideological aspects of the scientific community, and the undervaluing of anecdotal evidence. Actually, this is only true for the third topic; the first two he never discussed with me whatsoever.<br /><br />I never got the chance to discuss my father's book with him. He died two and a half years ago. In other words, my philosophical views were formed absent of him. <br /><br />Or were they? Even though we never discussed epistemology much, could it be that the worldview he taught me growing up influenced me to become the way I am? Or on the other hand could it be that there's something genetic to our philosophical leanings? I'll never know.<br /><br />He never told me about NDEs. This flabbergasts me, as talk of the spiritual and philosophy was not uncommon between us. If he thought so highly of the evidence in favor of NDEs then why did he never tell me about that? Sadly I'll never know the answer to that, or to my other questions I have for him, at least not in this life. However, there's always the afterlife. Which, now thanks to this book, I have increased capacity to imagine being a real thing.

&quot;This is my first venture into C.J. Cherryh's fantasy, and it's been a very happy occurrence, indeed.<br /><br />I was warned that the beginning takes a while to get into, but I didn't find it that way at all. We are introduced to two main characters primarily through their thought processes. While nothing is explained, everything is laid out with such intriguing hints of what's going on that I couldn't stop reading. Beautifully written, almost totally original (at least to my limited knowledge of fantasy), we are drawn into the world of Tristen, an innocent, born of a 'shaping' by the wizard Mauryl. The world as seen through Tristen's eyes is a marvelous place. Cherryh had to practically make herself born again to write this, I would think. The action never drags, things unfold, Tristen is forced to leave the tower where he was 'shaped' and venture into the world where he finds a kingdom in peril, a prince who becomes his friend, and gradually, he finds himself.<br /><br />While the book comes to a gratifying ending, I have to immediately start the next.<br /><br />First sentence: "It's name had been Galasien once, a city of broad streets and thriving markets, of docks crowded with bright-sailed river craft."<br /><br />Last sentence: "...but he thought that he would sit down on the rocks near the road, and wait, and see what the world of Men was about to be."&quot;

&quot;Although I love many books, there are few books I can read and reread and never, ever grow tired of them. This is one. It is unique, as exceptionally detailed and "alive" as any other Cherryh book, but it has a special place in my heart although I own each and everyone of her works I can find. <br /><br />For those who love historical fantasy of a type, epic fantasy, this is spectacular but not in an explosive way, but in the way where you love each and every character presented, good or evil, because they are so well-thought out and realized. You can see them vividly in your imagination. <br /><br />For me also, this is a beautiful example of what I tried to imbue my own writing with: examples of relationships between a man and another man where they truly love each other for who they are, without it having to be sexual or erotic. Tristan, the character you will meet if you begin in this book and continue in the series, is one who is ultimately terrifying for his power even though you love him as an example of what is the best in a pure soul which is honest and true.<br /><br />An outstanding series in every way for those of us who love fantasy on a grand and world building scale.<br /><br />For the full reviews and notes on the series, please visit my review/interview site <a href="http://flyingwithredhaircrow.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/the-fortress-series-by-c-j-cherryh/" rel="nofollow noopener">Flying With Red Haircrow</a>.&quot;

&quot;This is the first of a four-book series (not including a fifth, which I gather is set in a different time frame), and after having read only the first, I can't even guess what Cherryh might have in mind for the rest of this series. That's a good thing!<br /><br />I have a fondness for characters who live both within and obliquely to ordinary life, so the human-yet-otherworldly Tristen was my favorite. I like his innocence and rock-solid loyalty, and how "normal" adults in the story respond to him, and his fears about what he might be, and even the loneliness and melancholy his alienness sometimes brings to him.<br /><br />Have you ever had a time when you met someone, and knew right away that you'd be fast friends? Tristen and Prince Cefwyn have this kind of relationship, and at times it had a whiff of romance to it--for reasons that are too long to talk about here--though with the late-game introduction of Ninévrisë it was apparent the story won't head in that direction. There was a time I might have been disappointed about that, but I loved their interaction as is.<br /><br />Of course, there's a larger story surrounding these two young men, with half a dozen provinces in various states of truce or impending war, a mystical or haunted forest, cooked accounting books, powers from beyond the grave, magical writing, a disgruntled second prince, executions, ancient ruins, wizards, at least three different religions, a shadowy villain, a treaty, war preparations, battles, a thwarted and vindictive seductress, and much more. <br /><br />So...there are an awful lot of details to this story. I'm torn about that. At times they add to an intimate feeling of day-to-day life, even during war; at others they bog the story down. They can even manage to do both at once.<br /><br />For me, this book veered wildly between fascinating, suspenseful, dramatic, moving, and molasses-slow. I was sorely tempted to skim the slower parts of it--the maunderings on horse behavior or war materiel or cataloging of faceless attendants--once 500 pages had gone by of this hardcover. However, I resisted. In the end I was rewarded with a climax which brought many of the more important threads, some from the very first pages of the book, together in a satisfying way. I'm looking forward to seeing where Cherryh takes Tristen and Cefwyn in future volumes.&quot;
