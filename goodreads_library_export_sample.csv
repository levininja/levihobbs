I discovered that the director (Francis Ford Copolla) had worked closely with the writer (Mario Puzo), and this pleased me to know. <br/><br/>As I read (or rather, listened on audiobook, which I do recommend, as it has a very good narrator), I noticed all the little differences between the book and movie and concluded that they did not make one completely superior to the other. The differences struck me as largely there for good reasons. Things are simplified and condensed for the movie because the movie form needs to be even more powerful, evocative, and easy to understand without delving as much into inner thoughts of characters. In the book, there is more room to explore the back stories of many more characters, as well as room to look into inner motivations and thoughts more. The two works are both excellent in their own right, and while sometimes contradictory, not done so in flippant ways that would reveal a gross misunderstanding of the book.<br/><br/>At the beginning is an introduction by Copolla saying about Puzo, “I didn’t make him; he made me.” I admire this humility and honor that he paid to the man, and by the end of the book, I agreed with him.<br/><br/>What the book really adds (from the perspective of someone familiar with the film) is more character depth. There is a little more discussion of what the sons were like growing up and how they developed differently into their destinies. A mantra spoken by the Godfather throughout is that “every man has but one destiny,” and this is unfurled through the stories of his sons as well as a couple of other key characters whose rise is also unfolded more.<br/><br/>In the movies, the two hitmen that Michael uses to such devastating effect in the final act seem almost pulled out of nowhere. But in the books, both Rocco Lampone and Albert Neri have their own stories, explained succinctly, and their rise through the regime shown so that you understand how Michael came to acquire men of such talents.<br/><br/>Also explored in more depths are the stories of Johnny Fontaine, his friend Nino, Tom Hagan, Clemenza, Tessio, Luca Brasi, Carlo Rizzi, Connie, Kay, Kay’s father, mama Corleone, Jack Waltz, Captain McClusky, and others. Some of these characters are not even present in the films, or barely so. The result is a whole host of character’s stories in a full universe, a world even richer than the films.<br/><br/>Another aspect that makes it richer is a little more explanations of the thinking behind different key decisions, such as the recruitment of Al Neri and Rocco Lampone, as well as the Don’s thinking behind his appearing to be weaker while handing the reins over to Michael, his thinking on why and how to use out-of-control madmen like Luca, his thinking on how to say no, his thinking on so many things.<br/><br/>And that’s really where the jewels shine the most in the Godfather. Obviously the nuggets of wisdom to be obtained aren’t about how to kill people and extort and all that. The nuggets are about how to have friendships, how to take care of family, how to make yourself invaluable to others, how to handle people. Puzo said that the Italian people have the strongest family values of any culture, and those family values are what he considered to be the core of his story. I think that’s true. There is a lot of subtlety and variations on that theme, including many pitfalls openly displayed. It’s certainly not a naive telling, but rather a rich tapestry told with compassion as well as stark truth. There’s a lot to learn hear, and I’m sure I will be returning to this book many times throughout the years.<br/><br/>I should mention the one thing I didn’t like. There is gratuitous sex, moreso than in the movie, which I define as sex that does not significantly advance the characters and is told in more graphic detail than is useful or edifying—not that I think sex should never be discussed. At any rate, if you either don’t have the same feelings as me about sex, or are prepared to simply skip such sections, this does not have to be a major hurdle to enjoying the richness of the rest of the story.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the film many times, I would highly recommend reading this original book and discovering even more richness of characters and worldbuilding and wisdom than in the movies. You probably won’t regret it.",,,1,0

I was enjoying the view of southern life from a slightly alien perspective. The pronunciation of Southern slang was spot on in the audiobook version which I was listening to.   The setting was quaint, and the paternal figures and even minor characters were memorable and likable. I was having a good time as the story began.<br/><br/>Then it ended. What? I checked and double checked. There were the credits right there after these 4 chapters. No story had happened yet. I would really describe these first four chapters as a backstory that covers the early years of the main character’s life before getting to the main actual story, where Stuff Happens. But no. <br/><br/>This audiobook is 1 hr long, so maybe 8,000 words or so. It would have felt more accurate to call it a short story.<br/><br/>More to the point there needed to be more of a clear rising and falling action with resolution (plot) in order to feel like a cohesive complete story. I guess this could be called a coming of age story. There is one transformative event that happens toward the end. But there just isn’t enough conflict or rising tension.<br/><br/>But here’s the thing: I was thoroughly enjoying myself before it ended. Maybe the author just needs to keep writing?<br/><br/>One more thing: there needs to be more alien-ness in something called My Alien Life.<br/><br/>I received an ARC copy of this thanks to NetGalley. I don’t think that has materially affected my review.",,,1,0
