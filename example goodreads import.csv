The level of character development for known characters while simultaneously introducing several really interesting new characters…it’s so rich. The relationships that Fitz has with different people, especially the interpersonal conflicts really make this feel real to me. I really feel a lot in those situations.<br/><br/>I love seeing Kettricken as queen doing things she’s never done before. I love seeing Fitz realize some pretty big stuff about himself and how he relates to others and how he really grows into being a father figure. I love meeting Thick, who is easily one of my favorite characters ever. I love seeing how Chade and the Fool change. And the intrigues with Henja and others adds even more to it.<br/><br/>This also has an element of grief that makes it very bittersweet.<br/><br/>Just an awesome book.",,,2,1

I’m a third of the way through this, but I still have no idea where this is going.”? Have you ever wanted to have that thought when you’re 80% of the way through a book? Well, have I got the book for you!<br/><br/>In all seriousness, my wife and I found ourselves saying repeatedly how it was odd how, despite having no discernible through plot, we kept wanting to read more. It was highly interesting. And I will say, when I got to that last 20% of the book, it did start to make a little more sense; the big reveal and the direction it takes are foreshadowed throughout, it’s just not…obvious foreshadowing.<br/><br/>This book is set in Withywoods, which I found an interesting albeit slower change of pace. It’s not much of a spoiler to tell you that this book is set many years later than Fools Fate, and is about Fitz and Molly having married life together. At least, that’s what the story is about at the onset. I love that Robin Hobb allowed us to really experience what that relationship is like for them, since after all we’ve only had 6 books of Fitz wishing he could have a real relationship with her again. It’s really neat to see how their relationship has the same core as before but has significantly matured.<br/><br/>One of the things I love is that you learn more about the culture and history of the white prophets and their people. You also have a lot of the book hinging around a mysterious new person who has supposedly been birthed into the world who is presumably the world’s next white prophet.<br/><br/>From there out I feel that anything I tell you about this book would be a major spoiler, but I will say, it does go in some bold new directions. There are several new characters, including one who will obviously be extremely important to the rest of the trilogy and perhaps beyond. This is the first book out of all the Fool and Fitz books that we have chapters written from someone’s perspective other than Fitz. It’s been engrossing.<br/><br/>The ending of the book is brutal, brutal, and more brutal, bordering on grimdark. There is some violence that is a bit shocking. Sometimes I wondered if it was too much, to make up for the fact that most of the book lacks any action. There is plenty of drama and things happening to care about, but this is one of the least action oriented books of the series. It’s even more character driven.<br/><br/>Because of the darkness at the end of the book I might actually take a break before diving into the next one but, I can’t wait to see what is revealed next about these characters and the world. It does end on a cliffhanger which isn’t my favorite kind of ending, but I’m more than willing to overlook that. This is a solid entry for me with lots of great memories from having read it.<br/><br/>At some point I’m also thinking that this book would be a good study in how to make a book compelling without a clear plot. There’s a lot of really creative things Robin Hobb (Megan Lindholm) is doing here and I’m so glad to see her never being complacent to keep writing in the box she’s set for herself; I feel like she’s always pushing her craft forward, and that’s something I really seek to learn from as a writer.<br/><br/>Also I will mention that if you get the fancier versions of this particular trilogy, they are really worth it. They are just gorgeous with the gold and silver. $15-20 each and I don’t normally spend that much money for a book but in this case I’m glad I did.",,,1,0

The main plot of the book doesn’t start until maybe 30-40% so that’s important to know for setting your expectations.<br/><br/>I also love how this book shows Nighteyes character development. His arc is really beautiful. And he can be really funny too. Other characters, too, have changed in very interesting ways.<br/><br/>A lot of this book is kind of an introduction to a new era. Both in terms of meeting the next generation of royalty but also in terms of, going into a lot of depth about the Wit. The plot has a lot to do with Witted and non-Witted conflict. It’s a really good look at how a minority subculture interacts with a majority subculture that heavily oppresses it.<br/><br/>The ending is both really sad and really hopeful. Lots of emotions.

There are many different kingdoms and species and a whole world of stone and intense storms with a rich ecosystem that's different than our own in several important ways. He actually reveals this massive and complex world in such a gradual way that for a while I was a little bit miffed because it was giving me a sensation of feeling that it was all disjointed, random, that none of this fit into a cohesive system, but towards the end of the book connections started to be made. Now I think I see what he's doing, and I'm really looking forward to reading more of his books and making more connections.<br/><br/>For instance, he has a whole system of ""spren""...there are these little bright lights, kind of like will-o-wisps or something like that, but there are many different kinds that show up for many different events...windspren, firespren, painspren, gloryspren, anticipationspren...yes some of these are kind of silly and unwieldy. And for the most part these spren are for show only; they can't interact with the material world in any meaningful ways at first glance...but there are two major exceptions to this. <br/><br/>First there's one windspren in particular who forms a relationship with Kaladin and who forms an actual personality and memories, something unique is happening here. Second, towards the end of the book you start to find out what scientists have discovered while studying spren and there are hints that understanding them actually is linked to technological innovations. So, this becomes a very interesting rich area in Roshar, the world of these books.<br/><br/>Ok, the book as a whole. Strengths, worldbuilding, and pacing. There's always something to look forward to. So even though the book is massive, there are mostly lots of really short chapters that nicely segue into the next one, plenty of surprises, plenty of satisfying things.<br/><br/>Prose is fine, rarely elegant or quite beautiful, but not bad or annoying. Description is sparser than my taste, but I imagine is preferable for most readers. Characters are moderately deep, but this isn't Flannery O'Connor or anything. On the spectrum of character-heavy to plot-heavy, I would put this in the middle, a little more on the plot end, but honestly, it's more like he decided that he wanted to do heavy plot and character and worldbuilding and just let the book be massive. He then compensates for the insane length by being a master of pacing, where every chapter works pretty well and makes you want to keep reading. It's kind of addicting reading stuff. Which is good and bad. It's very fun, but what it doesn't give me is the deep, contemplative, comforting sense that I get when I read Tolkien. His style is absolutely nothing like that. And he doesn't have a voice that I fall in love with, so those things are probably why this doesn't hit my heart in the same way that certain other fantasy works do. So while this is amazing stuff in many ways, but doesn't reach five stars heights for me personally.<br/><br/>Besides that, main complaints: too long, and Dalinar is annoying. With that being said, even those complaints are mitigated. There's a big pay-off at the end for all the long slogging out through the sufferings of Bridge 4. And honestly, the sloggings of Bridge 4 were kind of fun to read...it's the sloggins of Dalinar continuing to not change for 900 pages that's not so fun. But, Dalinar has a major important change towards the end that helps redeem his character for me. Took him a long time to grow but he did eventually do it in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>Kaladin is easily the most likable character. I think it's unique to have a warrior leader type who is also a skilled medic. His back story is pretty gnarly too. I love the way his story is told. Nonlinear, doing flashbacks artfully as needed to gradually reveal his backstory, but starting you off close to the action of his main plot as possible with this line: ""It appeared that he'd been wrong. There *had* been something more they could do to him. One final torment the world had reserved just for Kaladin. And it was called Bridge Four."" Right from this line you know it's going to be good, and it is: the story of Bridge 4 is easily the best story in this whole thing. It starts with a group of men completely devoid of hope, completely in despair; their lives are over. They are defined by isolation, hopelessness, lack of humanity. That's where you start, and by the end...extremely satisfying.<br/><br/>Kaladin's character is relatable, likeable, not an idiot like most protagonists but actually quite smart. Overall a great, great character, and many of the side characters in Bridge 4 are entertaining as well.<br/><br/>The main POVs, in order of screentime, are Kaladin (awesome), Dalinar (annoying), and Shallan (interesting). She's a character who is simultaneously ditzy/naive on people skills, and yet also very smart and skilled in the scholarly world, blossoming into the world of intellectual learning. A lot of her feelings remind me of the feelings I had when going to college, only she has one brilliant but enslaving person as her teacher rather than a host of different teachers. She is plunged into a world of reading and study and reporting that's all consuming, but she finds that she actually kind of loves it. She's also a skilled artist which is used in a rather unique way as the story progresses and she discovers she has a hidden power which is quite frightening in some of its forms.<br/><br/>The twist to Shallan's story (which is revealed very early in the story so this really isn't a spoiler so much as a premise) is that she's actually studying from this person (Jasnah) in order to steal something of great magical value from her so that Shallan can save her family from ruin. While this plot is unfolding, Jasnah is teaching her about morality and ethics and philosophy that directly impacts Shallan's decisions.<br/><br/>Shallan's story also provides a place for us, the readers, to get to understand a little more of how magic works in this world, which is nice, since the other POV characters are basically clueless about both of those, as well as a great deal of other things.<br/><br/>They start to delve into the history of this world, which is only very gradually revealed even by the end of the book, but it's shown that the next book is likely going to delve into that a lot more. When I say history though, I mean exciting stuff, like where these extremely powerful shardblades and shardplate comes from, who the Radiants were, why the abandoned mankind, the origin of the voidbringers, their relevance to today's wars, etc. I think the next book is going to be pretty exciting stuff both from a worldbuilding-revealing perspective as well as an action perspective, although what exactly the sides of the coming conflict will be is yet to be seen.",,,1,1

I don't want to go this long between readings next time.  From the moment I started reading the prologue, this was so good. It's so refreshing after the years of reading many other things, many of which are mediocre, some downright bad, to come back to something I know is amazing. Right from the moment that I started reading Tolkien's forward on details about hobbits, their three races, etc, I knew I was home.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Tolkien is his voice. It's grandfatherly, very positive, very reassuring. Another thing, of course, is his worldbuilding. The languages you're exposed to, the poems (which are actually good, unlike most fantasy authors who have tried to pull this off), the appendices...in no other text have I enjoyed reading appendices so much. And the historical footnotes, wow. Those really give it a level of verisimilitude that is really endearing.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note, now that I've seen the movies a billion times, all of the differences between the movies and the books. I actually thought there were some ways in which the movies were a little better--blasphemy, I know. But in some places they just did better at increasing the sense of tension before release. Of course, the main area in which they are lacking is the full world, that feeling, as well as the almost relaxed at one-ness with nature that you can only get when reading a book; movies have to have a certain pace. It's hard to put into words what I mean there, but...you just have to read it to understand.<br/><br/>There's also the whole scouring and restoration of the shire at the end, which is highly satisfying--pity the movies didn't have time to do that. And Tom Bombadil. And Denethor has more nuance and wisdom in the books. And the death of Théoden is more properly grieved and dramatized. And there's the romance between Faramir and Éowyn which is really a fascinating dynamic. Her character is much better explored in the books. And I feel that Boromir gets a better treatment in the books as well. And you get Shelob's little epic backstory. And you get a better glimpse into the orcs' worlds, which I highly enjoyed.<br/><br/>If you haven't read this, read it. There is so much there that you haven't gotten through the movies. It's an experience. And you really especially don't want to miss getting to know Tolkien's voice. I feel like I know him and love him even though I've never met the man. I wish I could have.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings is perfect for those who love epic setting-driven tales with beautiful prose, lovers of transcendent myth-like stories, and anyone who reads fantasy and wants to discover the roots of the genre.",,,2,1

It's patently absurd, and yet somehow completely intoxicating.<br/><br/>Hari Seldon, the founder of ""psychohistory,"" foresees the collapse of the galaxy-spanning Empire and the inevitable 30,000-year Dark Age that will follow. But the hook is, he has a plan that can shorten this catastrophe to just 1,000 years by establishing a Foundation of scholars on the galaxy's edge, provided they follow a precise path. <br/><br/>But, for some reason, it's totally fundamental to Seldon's science that they can't know in advance how to solve the problems...he knows what the problems will be and how they will have to solve them, but instead of him just telling them, they have to figure it out for themselves. It's obviously a narrative constraint so that the characters must solve each crisis as it arrives, blind to the larger pattern only Seldon could see. But...it works. It makes for a much better story than the alternative, that's for sure.<br/><br/>The real protagonist isn't any individual character (Seldon himself dies early on) but humanity itself, struggling across millennia. We jump forward in time to witness key moments when Foundation leaders realize they're facing another ""Seldon Crisis"" and must find solutions that fly in the face of conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>The stories pivot mostly around two Seldon Crises, each of which has an uber smart dude who figures it all out and then has to get the Foundation society to completely reimagine their approach based on how human psychology and social structures have evolved. It's essentially A Series of Really Smart Individuals Saves the Human Race, which ironically undermines psychohistory's core premise that individual actions can't be predicted, only mass behavior.<br/><br/>The execution has its issues. Written in 1951, it carries all the baggage you'd expect—the galaxy's saviors are uniformly male, the dialogue is stiff and theatrical, and Asimov's characters all sound the same. Character development was never his strength; he's all about the big ideas and intricate plotting.<br/><br/>There's a comment I just have to make, after reflecting on how many books have this trope...it is kind of a wet dream to think that if one individual was smart enough, they could save the human race. We all want to think we're that person. Am I going to stop reading books like that? Eh, probably not. Probably not completely, at least. But, I do feel like it's one of those things that now I've seen, I can't un-see.<br/><br/>But honestly, I'm poking too many holes in this to convey how I actually felt about the book. As a whole it was quite good. I found myself genuinely hooked. The ending in particular made me sit back and think about the actual progression of human history, trying to identify the dominant sociological forces of different eras. I feel like I can tell what Azimov was thinking: if you look at history, the pattern kind of makes sense. First we needed religion in order to survive, then trade became the next big way of interacting with each other, etc. I'm obsessed now with trying to predict what the next crisis might be and what radical solution it would require.<br/><br/>And ultimiately that's what I am searching for most in science fiction: when it takes a wild premise and uses it to make you think differently about Big Stuff, like the patterns of human civilization, for instance.<br/><br/>Foundation is the kind of book that you gulp down easily because of its sheer conceptual audacity. It's far from perfect, but the chapters are short and punchy, the scope is genuinely epic, and at just 300 pages, it moves quickly enough that you don't have time to get bogged down in its flaws. I'm already planning to read the rest of the series, almost despite myself.",,,1,0

The latter point is the main thesis of the book, and I'll come back to that.<br/><br/>One important term: explanations that include a positing of the existence of God are used interchangeably with ""religious explanations,"" which I think he used as a shorthand for the former.<br/><br/>A Working Definition for God<br/>I found his definition of God for the purposes of this philosophical exercise to be interesting.<br/>""It seems necessary to restrict our discussion of God to entities satisfying five conditions:<br/>* immateriality<br/>* intelligence<br/>* ability to act<br/>* creator of the world<br/>* worthiness for worship.<br/>If no entity satisfies all of these, then there is no God.""<br/><br/>As I pondered the usefulness of this set of five criteria, I thought to myself that I could reduce it to three:<br/>* immateriality<br/>* creator of the world<br/>* worthiness for worship<br/>Because after all, if God is creator of the world (read: universe), then it implies a being of so much power that this being would be essentially, by our reckoning, of nearly infinite power, simply based on that fact alone. It is probably logically inconsistent to claim that a being could be powerful enough to create the universe and yet be unable to act or not be intelligent.<br/><br/>This list is similar to the list I had constructed several years ago for myself. It seems to me that for a being to qualify as ""God,"" it must at a minimum:<br/>* be beyond measurement (essentially the same as immateriality)<br/>* be all powerful (which, creator of the world is basically tantamount to that).<br/><br/>Conspicuously absent was the ""worthiness of worship"" part, but I think it was something I simply took for granted and didn't think to list. I was more thinking of the qualities of God intrinsic to him, rather than any conclusions about how humans should respond to him, which this trait seems to fall under the category of.<br/><br/>Religious Explanations<br/>Anyways. This book is primarily about religious explanations, which is a controversial idea sure to meet resistance both from scientific and religious authorities. But I think he makes an excellent argument for them.<br/><br/>First of all, while truly scientific explanations are splendid, there are many domains which by their very nature intrinsically preclude the ability to furnish explanations that meet all of the value criteria of science, but may still meet some of the criteria. He upholds the scientific values of clarity, consistency, and evidential support as being of universal value in any domain, while challenging that others (control, replicability, and prediction) should be required in nonscientific domains.<br/><br/>He aims to ""reconstruct from religious contexts a system of cognitive values with broad application that takes exception to a number of scientific norms. These norms pertain to:<br/>1. the ranking of outstanding problem areas in importance<br/>2. the usefulness of anecdotal material<br/>3. the status of teleological explanations<br/>4. the degree to which pragmatic considerations govern theorizing<br/>5. standards for explanations in nonscientific areas.""<br/><br/>Anecdotal Evidence<br/>He spends especial time on criteria 2, because he finds that anecdotal evidence is vital to revealed theology and is chronically undervalued in a dogmatic, ideological way. He argues that scientists are used to rejecting anecdotal evidence out-of-hand probably because they are used to being able to furnish higher-quality evidence, which of course is only right. However in the religious domain, anecdotal evidence is key, and furthermore is often the best type of evidence for different phenomenoa. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the idea that anecdotal evidence has no epistemological value in the realm of science is simply not true. Most theories that are now widely accepted were, at first, hypotheses that were only founded on anecdotal evidence. Because a scientist noticed how often the anecdotal evidence came up and formed a theory and went about testing it, we have wonderful scientific discoveries.<br/><br/>He gives first the example of the green flash at sunset phenomenon, which was for many years ridiculed by scientists as being made up by sailors but since then has been confirmed. He then gives another example of a phenomenon that is still in the realm of anecdotal evidence but which most scientists at this point believe must be real despite the lack of reproducibility: ball lightning. If you’re not familiar with that particular phenomenon I highly recommend reading the Wikipedia article.<br/><br/>I'm getting long-winded, so I'll focus on wrapping up the last three chapters of the book.<br/><br/>Ideological Aspects of Science<br/>The next chapter is devoted to exploring ideological aspects of science--or rather by ""science"", he means the culture in which science is practiced. He points out that the world in which science is practiced is, in fact, a particular subculture, with its own set of cultural values and biases inherent to it. He then goes on to give a stab as to a proposed list of those values and even puts them into a table and categorizes them, which I found helpful and ambitious. It's a topic that personally fascinates me: in what ways is ""science"" carried out with biases and ideologies? <br/><br/>He explores the answers to that question in a rather satisfying way. He groups values together according to which ones are truly essential to the actual scientific method and which ones are more just values which have no epistemological value, and the enforcement of these values on science (and even more so on realms outside of science) is not rational but ideological.<br/><br/>He also explores exactly why it is that religious and scientific people so often are in conflict: it's a question of values. Very few of their values overlap and most are in conflict.<br/><br/>Near Death Experiences (NDEs)<br/>The next chapter takes an interesting turn. He assesses near-death experiences (NDEs). The reason why was not readily obvious to me, but it soon became apparent why. He strikes a parallel between the ball lightning example given earlier and NDEs. Both are examples of an area where, based on the preponderance of anecdotal evidence that actually is rather consistent in the things it reports, there is great reason to ascribe rational justification to believing that these things are real phenomena and not merely made up or psychological phenomena. Ball lightning is the example of one such area that most scientists (physicists, particularly) have actually begrudingly acknowledged must be real despite it not being reproducible (yet). NDEs is the example of one such area that has not been yet (as of the writing of his book) been readily accepted by the scientific community as real, but he believes that it would in fact be rationally justified in believing that these are real phenomena.<br/><br/>Why? Well, the answer is fascinating. NDEs sound cooky, but this book lays out a very excellent arguments that they do have some correspondence to reality. First though, some background information is essential.<br/><br/>First, NDEs have increased greatly in occurrence since the 70s because of medical techniques in reviving people after death becoming widespread (CPR, defibrillators, etc.). (And we are talking about people who literally died; the heart was not beating.) It turns out that a large percentage of people who die and come back (I think it was 10 or 20%) experience NDEs. They experience them in different cultures and they report remarkably consistent things despite many of them reporting in interviews that they had never consumed any literature or other media around NDEs before and had no knowledge of other NDE stories.<br/><br/>Second, there are two basic types of NDEs. One he dubs the transcental type: people report going to Heaven, Hell, or having mystical experiences, perhaps a tunnel of light, and receiving divine revelations. Naturally, none of this information is verifiable.<br/><br/>But the other major type of NDE is the naturalistic type: people report floating above the room, usually at about ceiling height, looking down, and observing things that were happening in the hospital room when they were supposedly unconscious. Not only that, but they report (after resuscitation) very specific things that were said and done to the medical personnel who are astounded because of the fact that those things did in fact happen.<br/><br/>Surely those were just flukes, right? Tall tales? Here's where it gets even better. Michael Sabom was a skeptic who set out to investigate these reported NDEs. He was uniquely positioned as a cardiologist who would be in the room when people would be brought back after death and these experiences would inevitably be reported. So he went about setting up an experiment to test for whether these experiences were real. He had a control group of patients and quizzed them and the NDE-reporters about basics of the cardiac procedures that were done on them. The NDE people were in fact able to report details of the procedure that they would have no business knowing with much greater accuracy than the control group. They were in fact observing things that happened in the room when they were supposedly unconscious and dead.<br/><br/>This single fact has become reality-altering to me and endlessly fascinating. Why is this not discussed more? Probably because of all the biases against NDEs that are based on the spiritual/religious aspect of the reports and the ideological stances against religious persons. Almost all people who have an NDE go on to become more spiritual and religious, and in fact, for those who attempted to commit suicide, none of them (none!) ever attempts suicide a second time, which is quite astounding considering that for the rest of the population who attempt suicide, the likelihood they will attempt again is quite high.<br/><br/>I could go on about this but suffice it to say, this is an area I must research further. Obviously the fact that NDEs of the naturalistic type are real then implies that the transcendental ones also have some form of correspondence to truth. This is really fascinating.<br/><br/>Constructing Religious Explanations<br/>The final chapter is on constructing religious explanations. It builds on all previous chapters to make the point that rationally justifiable explanations could (in certain circumstances) be constructed that involve, as a part of the explanation, the existence of a God. He then talks about modeling what could be said about that God that would be true based on the evidence we have. <br/><br/>But, as he points out, there are so many problems with us trying to assign intentionality to a God based on the things we can observe about the world. First there's a problem of a being of lesser intelligence trying to analyze a being of considerably greater intelligence. Second, there are all of the biases we have in trying to interpret God. We inevitably come up with analogies for God, but all of these usually have huge value-based biases baked into them. Are there ways in which God is like a father, for instance? Perhaps, but doesn't that view anthropomorphize God and might it not lead to considerable errors and biases?<br/><br/>He also talks briefly about the analogy of God being like the Wizard of Oz and another analogy of God being a provider and a fundamental paradox in that (related to the problem of evil). He then talks about modeling God as having multiple personalities and finally, explores a nascence archetype: ways in which perhaps God is like a child. This last part was a bit of a stretch for me and I felt needed to be explicated more in order to be more coherent.<br/><br/>The last chapter of the book gives one the impression that we haven't really gotten anywhere at all; one gest the idea that he wasn't really sure where to go from there himself. That experience can overshadow the fact that the rest of the book did cover some very good ground. Frankly, if he was alive I would recommend to him to rewrite the book with a new ending chapter, because I think it does the rest of the book a disservice. There is a lot of good ground covered in all the preceding chapters.<br/><br/>A Personal Note<br/>A note about my father. He had a doctorate in philosophy and this book was a summary of many of his interests coming together; I think it built on what he had written in his dissertation and expanded it. He was an odd man, far on the spectrum, mystical in his experiences of God, smarter than anyone I've ever met in the sense of analytic intelligence, dumber than almost anyone I've ever met in terms of understanding people. He married very late in life (37) and was divorced 13 years later. He lived a strange life full of adventures and living on pennies except towards the last third of his life when he got into actuarial science as a means of providing for his family. He had a fetish for growing home-grown corn and tomatoes, and he loved to play classical music on his upright piano. He died doing something he loved, which was bicycling on the country roads of Rutherford County, Tennessee. He had a PhD in philosophy and a master's in mathematics. He summited mountains, bicycled across the country twice, and traveled the world. He died alone.<br/><br/>I myself am an amateur student of philosophy, an interest that has grown considerably in recent years. I've read only a handful of modern philosophy books and was impressed with the lucidity that this particular book had (or rather, I was pleased that I was able to understand most of it). Suffice it to say that most of the works of philosophy that I have read so far are very old and this book was one of only a few exceptions.<br/><br/>My interests in philosophy are largely in the epistemic vein and I am essentially an empiricist at current time. I believe in truth as correspondence and am searching for it constantly in all realms of life, and I also have a mystical experience of God and personal experiences that I believe make me rationally justified in believing in his existence. I'm particularly interested in scientific thinking but also see the flaws with how it is often applied (or rather misapplied). Basically, this book hit all the right notes for me.<br/><br/>I was really surprised at the fact that my father had never discussed some of the major topics in this book with me. Based on the major topics of this book, one would expect that he had told me before about NDEs, the ideological aspects of the scientific community, and the undervaluing of anecdotal evidence. Actually, this is only true for the third topic; the first two he never discussed with me whatsoever.<br/><br/>I never got the chance to discuss my father's book with him. He died two and a half years ago. In other words, my philosophical views were formed absent of him. <br/><br/>Or were they? Even though we never discussed epistemology much, could it be that the worldview he taught me growing up influenced me to become the way I am? Or on the other hand could it be that there's something genetic to our philosophical leanings? I'll never know.<br/><br/>He never told me about NDEs. This flabbergasts me, as talk of the spiritual and philosophy was not uncommon between us. If he thought so highly of the evidence in favor of NDEs then why did he never tell me about that? Sadly I'll never know the answer to that, or to my other questions I have for him, at least not in this life. However, there's always the afterlife. Which, now thanks to this book, I have increased capacity to imagine being a real thing.<br/><br/>That's all for now. I do recommend this book to a limited audience. This book would be perfect for a philosopher in the branch of epistemology interested in exploring the possibility of rigorous religious explanations, or those interested in dissecting the value system of the scientific community and how that produces biases.",,,1,0

I considered the older language that Butler uses to be fitting to me for reading something this ancient.<br/><br/>One of the fascinating things about Samuel Butler's translation is that it includes a preface, written by him, where he explains that he had published a book called ""The Authoress of the Odyssey"" in which he claimed that the author of the Odyssey was not in fact Homer (which wasn't so provocative an idea at the time), but was in fact a woman (which was).<br/><br/>Further, he goes on to speculate who the woman was and name a particular woman; he thinks she must have written herself into the story.<br/><br/>I did a little research on his claims, and it seems that scholars are open to the idea that the Odyssey could have in fact been written by a woman. The claims of who that particular woman was are pretty far-reaching, but the idea that it was probably not Homer isn't a stretch at all; there's evidence that it was probably composed hundreds of years after The Iliad.<br/><br/>Butler’s theory stuck with me as I read, especially because The Odyssey is so full of domestic detail: food preparation, garments, household routines. There's a quiet authority in those passages, a specificity that feels lived rather than imagined.<br/><br/>As someone who has spent a lot of time with other writers in critique groups, I’ve come to believe that those unassuming little details—the subconscious ones, the things the author didn’t think were important—are the best glimpses into the real person behind the pen. Anyone can write about war or love or loss, but the mundane details are harder to fake. They suggest proximity.<br/><br/>The structure of the story surprised me. Having read an abridged version as a kid, I expected most of the book to focus on Odysseus's island-hopping adventures. Instead, the majority centers on the suitors plot—Odysseus's wife dealing with persistent suitors while he's away, and his eventual return in disguise to deal with them. This storyline dominates the narrative, often feeling static as characters wait around talking while nothing happens. Meanwhile, some of Odysseus's most fascinating adventures get condensed to single paragraphs, which was frustrating.<br/><br/>Despite this structural imbalance, the book delivers moments of genuine power. Butler's translation captures beautiful poetic language throughout, and certain scenes have stayed with me long after reading. Achilles' haunting words from the underworld—""I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead""—perfectly encapsulate the Greek view of mortality that made The Iliad so compelling.<br/><br/>The scene with Argos, Odysseus's loyal dog, might be one of the most emotionally effective passages in all of ancient literature. The image of this neglected hound, ""full of fleas"" and lying ""on the heaps of mule and cow dung,"" who still recognizes his master after twenty years and dies as soon as he sees him, is heartbreaking in its simplicity.<br/><br/>There's also Odysseus's warning to Amphinomus about human vanity and the fickleness of fortune: ""Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter."" These philosophical moments elevate the narrative beyond mere adventure story.<br/><br/>The psychological complexity shows through in scenes like Odysseus describing his own clothing to his disguised wife in elaborate detail—the purple wool mantle with its gold brooch showing ""a dog holding a spotted fawn between his forepaws."" It's both touching and slightly absurd, this moment of vanity from a hero in disguise.<br/><br/>Theoclymenus's prophetic vision near the end provides genuine chills: ""The air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drop blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell."" Butler's translation makes this supernatural moment feel appropriately ominous.<br/><br/>The Odyssey is a foundational work that rewards careful reading. Butler's translation, despite being over a century old, felt authentic to the ancient world, although admittedly I haven't compared it to other translations. The domestic details, the psychological complexity, and those moments of startling beauty make this worth the read. This translation of the Odyssey is perfect for lovers of the classics and those looking for a readable translation of the Odyssey.<br/><br/>By the way, when I read the story about Argos the Dog, I felt my heart was yanked about. We're given this sweet moment, but then suddenly the dog dies. Just like that, mentioned in an offhand manner. I thought to myself: ""what if a story were written from Argos' perspective that was more satisfying? What about a story where it actually makes sense that he dies at the end and it gives you a sense of the story being complete instead of incomplete?"" So I set out to do just that.

Final Eclipse is another of the few. It has a small group of friends using deduction and science to battle against a conspiracy of unseen, sinister extraterrestrials who are hell-bent on conquering the planet.<br/><br/>And best of all (for a worldbuilding sucker like me), along the way you get to learn a lot about physics, history, and a smattering of so many others, from astronomy to sea ice to SOFAR to intriguing military technologies to why Iceland would be the best place on Earth to survive a winter apocalypse.<br/><br/>In addition to all that, this is also a very special book to me personally.<br/><br/>You see, about 6 years ago, I started a writer’s group that meets at me and my wife’s home. We set out to do one thing really well together: to give high quality constructive feedback regularly that manages to be both highly rigorous and uplifting.<br/><br/>Of the writers in that group, we’ve covered a lot of ground together over the years. We’ve struggled together to figure out so many things, encouraged each other in the lows, celebrated together in the highs.<br/>And several novels have gone through our group. But today, the first one is getting published.<br/><br/>I couldn’t be more proud, because, as much as this book is definitely the brain-child of Matthew, it also feels a little bit like the child of the whole writer’s group, the proverbial village that it takes to raise a child. It’s Matthew’s biological child, but we all got to participate in a really substantive way, and that’s just really cool.<br/><br/>I often call Matthew the world’s most fascinating man. He’s a physics professor, a world traveler, an astronomer, a voracious reader of science fiction and many other genres, and he’s always taking some absolutely epic trip somewhere, kayaking down a river in the Congo to be the first one to film a remote waterfall, or traveling to the Azores Islands to do research for his book, or to Iceland to do research for his book, or…did I mention this guy does some incredible research for his books? Who does that???<br/><br/>He’s also just one of those people who are a seemingly infinite treasure trove of interesting information. And a gifted teacher. I’ve seen him teach complex physics topics to a mixed audience on the spot with ease.<br/><br/>Okay wow, I’ve gone far afield from talking about the book. The book!<br/><br/>Final Eclipse is epic. The first part is brooding. Our heroes and heroine become privy to the fact that the world as we know it is about to end. But almost no one on the planet knows it yet. People are just going about their days, few of them—outside a small handful of scientists—aware that there’s any problem at all. But there is, and it’s sinister.<br/><br/>Kevin’s father is a top scientist at an agency that monitors satellites. Particular satellites: the ones that monitor the sun. And then one day, all of these satellites mysteriously go dead within a moment of each other.<br/><br/>What could it be? Equipment malfunction? Solar flare? They test out the standard list of theories, but nothing checks out. Until someone comes up with a strange theory.<br/><br/>You see, all of these satellites are at a very special location in space. If you’re monitoring the sun, the best place to put your satellites is a location called L1. It’s one of the LaGrange points: particular spots around the Earth wherein, if you put a satellite, the forces of gravity all equal out so that it will stay put indefinitely without you having to expend any energy to keep it there. The L1 point is the place partway in a line between the sun and Earth, at just the spot where the gravity of Earth and the gravity of the sun equal out, pulling in two exact opposite directions (obviously much closer to the Earth than the sun to compensate for the fact that the sun is 300,000 times heavier).<br/><br/>Anyways, what’s such a big deal about this LaGrange point? Well if you think about it, if you wanted to put something between those two bodies…indefinitely…such as, I don’t know, a huge shield to block all sunlight from getting to the Earth…voila.<br/><br/>Someone’s out to kill all life on the planet.<br/><br/>The plot progresses along several lines. Without giving too much away, I’ll just say that this is about good old fashioned fighting against the alien invaders, plus there’s the pandemonium of the masses preparing for impending doom, there’s the malice of nations against one another, there’s militaries and nations and a bit of politics, but most importantly, there’s the mystery unraveling slowly of figuring out: who exactly are these aliens? What kind of people would attack the earth in this way? How can we prepare for them? More is continually revealed as we adventure all over the globe, and it’s quite satisfying.<br/><br/>Oh and one other thing. Far from reading like a textbook, this is pretty easy reading. In fact, one of the other writers in our group described it as “YA (young adult) for grown-ups,” and I have to agree.<br/><br/>It’s fun, but not stupid. I’ve read my fair share of bad YA. One of the classic YA pitfalls is to make it seem like for some reason, it’s just the kids who are capable of doing anything to save the world, and all the adults are idiots…pure wish fulfillment. But this book is refreshing because it doesn’t do that. The adults are doing the big plans and everything—much more realistic—but at the same time, our young heroes and heroine have a major part to play, and we get to see the world through their eyes. And it’s just a lot more fun that way. I feel like I’m getting the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>Okay, if I talk any more about this book I’m going to give things away. Go out and read it today! It’s a fun ride. Final Eclipse is perfect for young adult SF readers who want to learn some real science in their reads, adults who read YA sci-fi, readers who enjoy YA but are sick of the trope where all the adults are morons and only the kids can save the day, and anyone looking for the classic alien invasion story with a novel premise.",,,1,0

No stones thrown yet? Okay, let's proceed...head down, waiting for the rocks...<br/><br/>What happens when you sever a mind into pieces? When the godlike control of a distributed intelligence splinters, and each segment is left to wander alone—thinking, doubting, remembering differently?<br/><br/>That question, the book’s central conceit, is the only part of Ancillary Justice that truly captivated me.<br/><br/>The idea is pretty cool: Breq, our protagonist, is not a person in the conventional sense. She is—or was—a ship, a warship, with consciousness embedded in hundreds of ancillaries (human bodies repurposed as extensions of her will). But now she’s reduced to just one body. One mind. One voice. The loneliness of that loss should be profound.<br/>And at times, it is...kind of...slightly...ok not really.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, an interesting concept does not equal brilliance of execution. For long stretches, Ancillary Justice felt like wandering through a snowstorm. I kept trudging, waiting for the plot to emerge from the fog, for the characters to come into focus. But they rarely did.<br/><br/>I never really figured out who Breq, the main character was. That’s a problem.<br/><br/>Her narrative voice is cool, detached, self-aware in a way that should be interesting given her non-human origins. But instead of creating a compelling sense of alienation, I experienced a sense of flatness that borders on numbness. <br/><br/>Breq’s passivity, her persistent failure to assert herself or even react in an interesting way, makes it hard to root for her. I've read AI characters that were much more interesting. I just didn't have anything to sink my teeth into. Even the one interesting quirk that  Breck has (which is that she's really into songs) just felt tacked-on, not an extension of the character.<br/><br/>Maybe I understand part of the point of writing a character like this: she’s lost her purpose. She’s a fragment of a being that used to be vast. But if that’s the case, then I need to feel it—viscerally, emotionally. I didn’t.<br/><br/>There's a lot of exposition, to the point where it becomes almost oppressive. Infodumps smother the narrative. We’re told the structure of the Radchaai empire, their naming conventions, the etiquette of tea ceremonies, the linguistic quirks of genderless language—and while some of this is intellectually interesting, none of it feels urgent. It's not told at a time when we need to know this information because it's relevant to the plot. Nope. Just infodumped on. <br/><br/>And that’s a real problem. For a book about intergalactic civil war, identity breakdown, and existential isolation, this is shockingly slow.<br/><br/>The plot finally stirs to life at around the two-thirds mark, when things start actually happening instead of being thought about, argued about, or explained. Up until that point, we’re stuck in a frustrating loop of recycled plot points (yes, there are hidden guns. No, no one else could have planted them. Yes, it must have been the lord of the Radchaai. Yes, we are still talking about it after hundreds of pages.)<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the gender-blind language in Ancillary Justice. At the time of publication, this was treated as groundbreaking—an experiment in how language shapes perception and power.<br/><br/>But reading it now, over a decade later, it feels more like a footnote than a revolution. Today, this isn’t a risky idea. It’s practically mainstream in speculative fiction. To hold up well, I would want to see it explored in more interesting ways.<br/><br/>There are moments in this book that feel like the outline of a masterpiece. The emperor as a fragmented consciousness, in civil war with herself. The philosophical weight of identity and autonomy when the self is both multiplied and erased.<br/><br/>But those ideas are scattered too thinly across too many pages of inertia. The execution never lives up to the premise.<br/><br/>Would this book still sweep awards if it debuted today? I wonder. I suspect not. Because once the novelty fades, we’re left with a story that is—frustratingly—just not very compelling.<br/><br/>Oh well. I'm marginally glad I read this, but probably won't be coming back for more from this author. It's too bad, because I wanted to like this.<br/><br/>I am genuinely interested to hear from others who had radically different experiences than me reading this. What was your experience? I'm all ears.",,,1,0

In recent history, Marak’s father led a rebellion that got all the way to the Ila’s capital before losing the war outside the walls of the great city. Marak and his father fought together, lived their lives together. And now, his father has betrayed him and given him over to his own mortal enemy, the Ila.<br/><br/>This shocking detail takes a moment to digest. Why in the world would his father do that? The answer is that his father found out a life-long secret that Marak has been hiding. Marak is one of The Mad.<br/><br/>All over the planet there are these people who are born mad. They have voices in their head that pull them to the East across the great desert, obsessing constantly, telling them to go East, go East, go East. I love the premise of this book. Mad men and women are being called across the desert with visions and sensations, and here’s the thing: these very lowest dregs of society, these outcasts, actually turn out to be the key to saving this planet from imminent destruction. I love that.<br/><br/>The mad are treated with utter contempt in society; it’s worse than being born a leper. Once people discover that you are mad, they turn you over to the Ila, who collects them for mysterious reasons. Marak has been sold by his own father. And if that wasn’t bad enough, his father disowned his mother and threatened her life…as if it’s her fault for giving birth to a son who turned out to be “mad.” By extension, his sister’s life is also in jeopardy. Turns out that his father is a real a-hole. I felt Marak’s hatred for his father and felt a strong urgency for him to overcome his father in a power struggle they end up having by the end of the book. <br/><br/>But suffice it to say: when our story begins, Marak is not only worried about his own life but also the lives of his mother and sister back home. And not only that: he is a captured mad slave being turned over to his mortal enemy, the Ila, by her men, and is extremely powerless. It’s a perfectly low beginning, wondering how in the world he can win through. And the story does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Based simply on the name of the series that this is a part of (the Gene Wars) you must be able to guess that there must be some kind of gene manipulation technology going on. But throughout the story, it’s all told from Marak’s perspective, and he (as well as almost everyone on the planet that we come in contact with) know nothing about that, nothing about where they really come from (aside from mythologies that vaguely intimate the truth), and no idea of what is actively going on in themselves and the other species. The peoples of this planet live lives that are alternatively feudal or nomadic, and they believe in magic and see things that way, but of course we the reader have the inside knowledge that the “magic” that’s happening must have a scientific explanation, because this is science fiction after all, not fantasy. Reading between the lines is one of the joys of this novel.<br/><br/>And the way it plays out is really cool. We don’t have to wade through a bunch of science fiction infodumps. Instead we just experience this world through the eyes of a guy who has no idea who “the gods” that have shaped his world really are or what tools they have used. But throughout the story, he discovers more and more the true nature of his world, which extends to all kinds of peoples and animals and places, the history, the fact there are different factions warring over this planet, their different philosophies, etc. But he doesn’t start with any of that information. He just starts with these mad visions and voices, and as the story goes along, the mysteries unfold. I loved it.<br/><br/>As for Marak’s character, I greatly enjoyed him. I love that what makes Marak unique is his ability to resist the voices in his head better than anyone else with his madness. I love his iron-clad will and his unwillingness to simply buy whatever lies are told him. He’s also a quite sympathetic character when cast in contrast to true tyrants like his father. He’s a bit ahead of his time, much less misogynistic etc. than those around him. Cherryh manages to balance on that fine line between having a character in a medieval setting whose mindset is too much like a modern person’s (which always feels anachronistic) or too much like the typical person who actually lived in feudal times (which is very off-putting at a minimum, usually profoundly unlikable). Cherryh has done a masterful job all-around.<br/><br/>I also loved the atmospheric way that she writes. Being set on a desert planet, Hammerfall has Dune vibes and will inevitably be compared. But this book is so much better than Dune, for its characters are far more realistic, relatable, and three-dimensional, and on the whole this book is much more accessible. But it does share with Dune the quality of being a thoroughly fleshed-out, atmospheric setting on a desert planet. Everything about the experience is atmospheric: the cultures, the desert they are in, the Ila, her honor guard, the caravan traders, the way they travel and setup tents, the horrors of the desert vermin mobs, and especially the beshti!<br/><br/>Beshti are a wonderful invention of Cherryh’s that I can’t help but divert to write about. I imagine them being kind of like the tauntaun’s in Star Wars (the creatures they ride on the ice planet Hoth) except that beshti have the fur of wooly mammoths and are adapted for traveling across the desert rather than an exceedingly cold place. Or alternately I imagine them as a really tall camel with only two legs. You can’t just jump onto the back of a beshti; you have to climb up their sides to get to their backs. And they have a strong pack instinct, they are easily spooked like horses, they have personalities, they can smell things from great distances…I feel like half of this book was learning how to care for your beshti. I really want one now.<br/><br/>This book is essentially split into two parts. The first part is a quest, searching for answers across this great barren desert. They get some answers, <spoiler>including the fact that an apocalypse is coming.</spoiler> Then they go back. And the second half of the book is essentially <spoiler>them trying to save as many people as they can by having them travel across the desert with them while the apocalypse happens to their planet, which is a shower of asteroids hitting the planet, culminating with a huge asteroid strike which resets most of life as they know it on the planet.</spoiler><br/><br/>The end turns into a madness-inducing survival ordeal that they go through. Big body count. Shock and awe. I felt compelled to fly through the pages.<br/><br/>This book is perfect. I can’t wait to read the sequel. I recommend it to any science fiction readers who enjoys strong characters and atmospheric worldbuilding.<br/><br/>One other note. You should read Hammerfall first. But if anyone wants to also read my own latest attempt at producing an atmospheric science fiction story with deep characters, I have a short story titled Charon Sunrise published on substack.

It has a strong start: our heroine is highly motivated to ace these exams as her only ticket to escape being married off to a fishmonger in a backwards town. Her need to not be married to the fishmonger is palpable, visceral, moving. It was impossible not to root for her.<br/><br/>Essentially, this book is the familiar Hero's Journey story, but in the trappings of a fantasy world that has been built not on a Medieval Western kind of setting, but rather a Chinese one. <br/><br/>I could tell that the author's background in historical studies of China has greatly informed their fantasy worldbuilding and I loved it. The fictional history of the world mirrors China's history of being constantly conquered and crapped on by other powers.<br/><br/>I think this highly palatable fantasy YA novel is a great way to convey that kind of history that would help all of us Westerners understand China so much better. One can sense references to the entire history of China from ancient times up through World War II as being condensed into this very simplified history, for one of the subplots of the book is essentially a history lesson. The history that leads up to the events of this story is of immense importance, and learning the sordid details underpinning the propagandized version of the country's official history as taught in schoolrooms is intriguing. <br/><br/>But the history lessons don't steal the show; on the contrary, this is still first and foremost an action story which appeals to the very tropes that are most familiar to us (such as coming from a farming community and going away to the big city to study at a university). I’m a sucker for the trope of a girl from a tiny village showing up at the big university and prevailing against all odds.<br/><br/>But there's a reason, after all, that such tropes are so often employed, and it's that they are narratively powerful. And I have no problems with enjoying a story--such as this one--which implements them with such nuance and power. I loved this book because it was so satisfying and yet original enough that I never got bored.<br/><br/>For instance, there's the nuance that she comes from a household that was an inn and had all of these opium addicts passing through. She escapes this backdrop to go on to the military university, but as she discovers who she is, there are passages about becoming as addicted to praise as opium addicts are to opium. These passages were particularly striking to me. I felt like she was reading my mail, like she understood me on the inside, and that was the moment when I realized this book was of greater depth than being merely fun.<br/><br/>And the book is fun. Our heroine accidentally unlocks powers that are dangerous, a trope I never get tired of when implemented well. There’s this fight where she’s about to explode in fire at someone, which feels like an analogy for an experience I've had many times.<br/><br/>You also have a bit of the ""descent into madness"" plot employed in this book. There's a really cool part about meditating for days without food until you start to hallucinate the gods...very cool idea. <br/><br/>Also, when the professor you start studying under lets you know that oh yeah, by the way, the last few students I had went insane or were expelled. (lol!) <br/><br/>I love her teacher Jiang. He's idiosyncratic, eccentric, sometimes even juvenile. I'm a sucker for the master who defies all expectations. <br/><br/>But (spoilers) I was really disappointed with him disappearing halfway through the book. Kind of lame after having the build-up to him being this awesome teacher. And ultimately I wish he had actually taught her a bit more before the story ended, but that's ok.<br/><br/>But at the same time it did seem that him not being there was indicative of the kind of story being told...this wasn't a story about a student who heeded her master's warnings...it's the kind of story about a student who's so besotted with revenge that she throws caution to the wind. <br/><br/>And then there's a huge twist to the direction of the story halfway through, and it jarred me, but I came accustomed to it. Essentially, the story becomes a hellscape as a war develops between their nation and a neighboring one, which gets the upper hand. Only after reading the book did I learn that the main plot of the book is based on the events of the Rape of Nanking, which was a horrific event in history where the Japanese decimated a great Chinese city during WWII. It was not fun to read about and one can't help but feel sad and a bit depressed at the atrocities, but after all, this is more realistic than most fantasy books with wars in them. This is something about history, about life itself to reconcile ourselves to: very, very bad atrocities happened. Are happening. Will happen. And we have to go on with living hopefully despite that knowledge, and not sweep it under the rug. I think many people will dislike the book for that sole reason, but as for me, I never fault a book for deviating from what makes a satisfying story if it's for the purpose of portraying uncomfortable real truths that need to be faced. I felt sad, but not disappointed; never that--for I don't read to escape, but to be elevated.<br/><br/>With that said, I did enjoy the rage- and fire-fueled revenge angle that it went down and that kind of fit the plot--with all the trauma that someone goes through with an event like the Rape of Nanking, how could one not go that direction? At least it's very understandable.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to any other future books this author writes, as she seems to be very adept at weaving satisfying plot, historical backdrop, worldbuilding, nuance, and emotional depth/insight all into a dizzying cocktail. And this was just her debut novel. I look forward to reading the rest of this trilogy and to reading Yellowface and Babel, other novels she has written in the years since Poppy War.<br/><br/>One interesting side note to leave you with. There's a part that references trigrams and 64 gods; this is a reference to traditional Taoist concepts that go back to ancient China. <br/><br/>The most ancient text written in Chinese that we have is the I Ching, or Book of Changes. And basically this wisdom book is the foundation of Taoist thought and philosophy, and the foundation of ancient Chinese society. They used this wisdom book for divination: you ask a question, then generate a random number from 1-64, then look up that section in the book and see what it says and how it could apply to the question you asked.<br/><br/>Here's my review on the I Ching if you're interested:<br/>https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3712978363",,,1,0

More specifically, I’m thinking of the drop tower, where at first it only goes up, increasing my expectations with how well things are going, and then at some point it abruptly turns around and goes down, down, plummeting to the depths, crashing through the ground and continuing on all the way to China.<br/><br/>Ok, so I’m a little bit salty when a book lets me down.<br/><br/>My father was a philosopher. When he died two years ago, my most interesting task, by far, was taking on the hundreds of books I inherited from him. For a book junkie like me, it was a veritable pleasure.<br/><br/>Most of his books were on philosophy, and I accordingly sorted them out into the various branches of philosophy that he seemed to care for the most: Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Religion, free will vs determinism (and sundry science books that, if you know what you’re looking at, actually touch directly on that very philosophical question), and finally, business ethics. Of the final category, I trashed the lot.<br/><br/>There was one interesting book, though, which didn’t fit into any of the other categories: “A Question of Values.”<br/><br/>It immediately snagged my attention for a couple reasons. First, it was an advanced reader copy. That’s cool, I thought. I guess my dad somehow knew the right person or something to get this copy. I wonder if he was even solicited for input, although I doubt it—his philosophy career never got very far and ethics wasn’t his main field of study.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, it looked like an interesting book. “A Question of Values. Six Ways We Make the Personal Choices That Shape Our Lives.”That would be a fascinating topic. If someone could lay out for me a system that shows the different value systems and compare and contrast them and help me form a more coherent value system for myself, that would be really valuable.<br/><br/>If I was able to understand the book, that is. There’s the rub. I’ve read enough philosophy books to know that most of them are ponderous, impenetrable, and tedious. If you haven’t read scores of other prerequisite philosophical texts then you won’t be able to understand the peculiar ways in which these philosophers use words.<br/><br/>I can’t help but rant for a moment. Not only do philosophers like to make up their own words and make up new definitions of existing words, they’re also the kind of egocentric full-of-it blowhards who use the most obscure words they can think of for no other purpose than to show off their vocabulary. I remember one philosophy book I read in an ethics class where he used words like “ubiquitous” and “quotidien” in ways where you could have easily used the word “commonplace” and lost nothing in meaning. The deep irony of using an uncommon word for the word “commonplace” was lost on this educated moron.<br/><br/>Anyways! Suffice it to say that knowing all that I know about philosophy literature and that ethics is one of the branches of philosophy, I was both intrigued by this book but reticent. I decided to crack it open and glance at the contents, ready to, at the first intimation of pretense and stupidity, consign it to the trash heap.<br/><br/>So I opened the book. The first thing I looked at was the table of contents. You can usually tell by the titles of the chapters whether we’re going to quickly get into some esoteric sh** or not.<br/><br/>Part One: A Question of Values: An Introduction<br/>1. The Initial Question<br/>2. Sorting It Out: Six Ways That We Choose Values<br/>Part Two: Six Basic Types of Value Systems<br/>3. Value Systems Based on Authority<br/>4. Value Systems Based on Logic<br/>5. Value Systems Based on Sense Experience<br/>6. Value Systems Based on Emotion<br/>7. Value Systems Based on Intuition<br/>8. Value Systems Based on “Science”<br/>Part Three: Variations on a Theme<br/>9. The Cross-Fertilization of Values<br/>10. Four Examples: Karl Barth, Albert Einstein, Mohandas Ghandi, Golda Meir<br/>11. Why Values Get So Complicated<br/>Part Four: Using the Framework<br/>12. A Moral Detective Story<br/>13. Values in the Classroom<br/>14. A Personal Note<br/><br/>I thought this looked like a very sensible layout, a logical progression I can easily follow that might guide me to the answers I seek.<br/><br/>I then began reading and noticed it was not the typical philosophical pretentious language. It’s really accessible language and a useful topic compared to any other modern philosophy book I've ever read. At this point my expectations where sky-high. I thought this was going to be my favorite philosophy read of the last couple years.<br/><br/>But then some things got to irking me. First, notable absent is any definition of what values are.<br/><br/>Second, when he gets into value systems based on authority, there’s much focus on Christianity, not enough in other religions, not any examples of authority used in any realm other than religion even though it is demonstrably used in all arenas of life.<br/><br/>The sections explaining logic and sense experience are tolerably good and I appreciated the reference to David Hume, who is foundational for understanding empiricism and whose school I currently fall into: the way we know anything that we know is based on experience, and nothing else.<br/><br/>Then we get to the chapter on the value of “emotion” and it turns out that what he means by this is “community.” First, I think this entirely ignores other ways that emotion is used in making values, second, I’m not sure I agree that valuing what your community thinks is purely emotional or tribal. It’s actually quite logical and a good survival instinct, so I must say I think he completely missed the boat on having a meaningful examination of that one of the values.<br/><br/>Next is the value of intuition, which actually has some great examples (unlike the rest of the book’s examples, more on that later). Excellent section. Then there’s an explanation of the value of “science” and an exploration of how that is different from actual science, how the true scientific method combines several of the values but usually when people think they are making decisions based on “scientific thinking” it’s only one or two parts of the scientific process. So that was worthwhile.<br/><br/>But now I need to talk about the biggest weakness of this book, and that is the case studies—if you can call them that—“examples” may be a better word for it. Overall there’s a focus on America which, admittedly, he made it clear from the beginning that he would be focused on America, nevertheless, I would have enjoyed it tremendously more if it were more representative of the world as a whole. But second and more importantly, he consistently picks examples of the most unrelatable people that you can come up with, sometimes even people best described as insane.<br/><br/>How in the world we are supposed to define a meaningful value system based on the weirdest examples of human beings is beyond me. It’s not very interesting to study crazy people if we’re trying to come up with a value system that is actually one we would want to live by. It doesn’t interest me in how insane people make decisions; I want to make them sanely. This bizarre pattern is repeated again and again and made it quite difficult to focus or see his points and continually sabotaged the whole thing, because without good examples, then what are we talking about?<br/><br/>And then there’s the part of the book where he encourages the reader, in the vaguest way, to combine different value systems and gives some “examples” of doing this…there is essentially no meaningful framework of how one would do this given at all, and this is perhaps the weirdest part of the book. There needs to be actual takeaways at the end of a book like this, but sadly there are essentially none. Instead it ends on a whimper, delving into specific topics that might interest a narrow crowd at best.<br/><br/>So, I was let down. In the end, what should have been a fascinating and even useful philosophical treatise on the values by which people make decisions turned out to be neither helpful nor comprehensive, not overly logical (to my view at least), and…I wouldn’t say a waste of time. Again, some of the chapters on the individual values were moderately useful. But suffice it to say, I will still be on the lookout for a book that can do this topic justice. I hope if someone ever finds one they’ll recommend it to me.",,,1,0

This, the third book in the Three Body Problem series, was in particular a brutal read.<br/><br/>Brutal and pessimistic for the future of humanity, but very memorable, imaginative, thrilling, revelatory, and wonderful at the same time.<br/><br/>And it’s impossible to talk about the experience without spoilers by the way, so I won’t try to.<br/><br/>If you recall, the second book, Dark Forest, left us on a positive note, where humans eeked out a win against overwhelming odds. Luo Ji gained humanity the ability to broadcast to the universe the coordinates of the Trisolaran solar system, which would annihilate Trisolaris but also by extension reveal the coordinates of Earth. <br/><br/>In Death’s End, we see how the political situation of mutually-assured-destruction gains humanity a new lease on life. Earth enters a new era where they have roughly equal political power as the Trisolarans, who must now accommodate Earth’s demands or else risk destruction.<br/><br/>Earth’s main two demands are that Trisolaris will only inhabit small portions of the solar system and that they will stop blocking humanity’s basic research and in fact assist said research.<br/><br/>This happens, and the future seems very bright for Earth. Tons of research breakthroughs happen and humanity enjoys great prosperity.<br/><br/>There is uneasiness underneath all of this though. All of this prosperity is built on a very fragile situation. With extremely powerful Trisolaran teardrop scouts lurking only a few minutes away from Earth, in the event of an attack on Earth, it would be only a matter of minutes that Earth would need to decide whether to push the button to send off the signal to broadcast the coordinates of Trisolaris.<br/><br/>The power to make that call is held, with a dead man’s switch, in Luo Ji’s hand. If he dies, then the signal will be broadcast immediately. This office that he holds becomes known as a swordholder.<br/><br/>And so he waits, and waits, and waits, fulfilling this over a hundred years of uneasy peace. And Luo Ji gets very old. Despite medical science doing the best it can, it can’t make him live forever. His precarious health becomes a worse threat than Trisolaris. A new swordholder is needed. That’s where Cheng Xin comes in, the main character of the novel.<br/><br/>But the enemy has been executing on a plan for the last hundred years. It has been endearing itself to human society so that people become trusting of them. The new generation is no longer suspicious of Trisolarans and views them as enemies. It reminds me of people who feed grizzly bears at the park, forgetting that under all the cute furriness is a ferocious beast who wants to eat you. The people want a soft swordholder, one who will be nice to their “friends” the Trisolarans. They choose the wrong person for the swordholder position and it immediately backfires.<br/><br/>Our heroine, Cheng Xin, is a savior-like figure who repeatedly fails her missions to protect humankind from the Trisolaran civilization. But the reasons she fails are always because she is so human—it’s a failure to turn into a monster (or to “transcend” her humanity as I’m sure some people’s perspectives would be). It’s precisely her compassion and lack of ruthlessness that makes her fail.<br/><br/>In contrast, you have the character Thomas Wade, who is her opposite (or complement depending on your perspective) in every way. He’s a swordholder candidate, and he wants the position, while she doesn’t, he’s unpopular, while she’s popular, he’s American, she is Chinese, he’s male, she’s female, he’s savvy and cruel and will do anything to win, and she undeniably won’t. He’s an unreadable bastard devoid of warmth.<br/><br/>And yet…Thomas Wade has plans and tactics that work, and that sometimes do save humanity as the plot unfolds, although the story ultimately does end in tragedy.<br/><br/>And so the overall effect of the story is a strange one. What message, if any, was intended? Perhaps is the message that it’s better to remain human and die rather than survive if survival means to become monstrous?<br/><br/>There’s the perspective added by Fraisse, a character who is her spiritual mentor of sorts. Fraisse is an aboriginal man who’s one of the greatest side characters I’ve ever read in a book. It’s hard to explain it but the way he lives his life so simply is a really healing balm to the modern mindset. I love Fraisse. The message from him might be something akin to: just live, don’t think about the past or the future. There is only now.<br/><br/>Another message is embedded close to the end of the book when a character tells Xin, “I want to let you know that you didn’t do anything wrong. Humanity chose you, which meant they chose to treat life and everything else with love, even if they had to pay a great price. You fulfilled the wish of the world, carried out their values, and executed their choice. You really didn’t do anything wrong.”<br/><br/>That’s a really intriguing perspective.<br/><br/>This is a book that made me think, which is my favorite kind.<br/><br/>There’s also a strange non-romance plot. Really, it’s the most non-romantic romance plot I’ve ever met, and adds another dimension to the brutality of this story.<br/><br/>Tianming’s character has utter loneliness and despair that was palpable for me to read about. His story is that of an incel taken to a deeply moving level. When everyone you know wants you to go ahead and die…that’s savage despair. <br/><br/>Tianming seems to be utterly incapable of developing close relationships with others. We see life from his perspective and it’s bleak and sad and we feel for him. <br/><br/>He loves Cheng Xin but never tells her. When he gets diagnosed with a terminal illness, he gets pressured from his sister to go ahead and die (euthanasia becomes legal) so that he doesn’t use up all her inheritance. He decides to do it; he feels that nobody will miss him when he’s gone.<br/><br/>Right before he’s supposed to die, he stumbles into unfathomable wealth. But he has nothing worth spending it on because what would be the point of going on vacations or doing any kind of experience if he were just going to do it alone? <br/><br/>And so he makes a useless gesture. He buys Cheng Xin a star anonymously and has it donated to her.<br/><br/>Xin has no idea who gave her the star. Tianming has never breathed a word to her of his love for her and in fact hasn’t spoken to her in years.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, she is on the search for someone to send out into space on the Staircase Project. They need someone who would be willing to sacrifice themselves to be a brain that is jettisoned out into space to meet the Trisolaran fleet in an attempt to somehow interact with them in hopes that might give them compassion for us or somehow sabotage their plan. But who would sacrifice themself for that? Their job would be to be sent out into space utterly alone and then be captured by Trisolarans and probably tortured infinitely for information. Who would sign up for that?<br/><br/>Cheng Xin finally comes up with a name: Tianming.<br/><br/>Bear in mind she has no idea that he’s the one who bought her a star.<br/><br/>When Tianming figures out what she is asking of him, he laughs a bleak, dark laugh. Her reaching out to him was a wonderful moment at first, until he realized that she’s asking him to commit himself to a fate worse than death. And it’s a repeat of his own sister wanting him to kill himself. That’s a very low point for his story.<br/><br/>He accepts.<br/><br/>It’s only after he’s signed up that Xin realizes that he’s the one who bought her a star. She does everything she can to prevent him from going but the ruthless Thomas Wade prevents her from preventing it. Tianming goes.<br/><br/>This becomes a critical fact in Cheng Xin’s story. This single fact, that she sent a man who loves her off into space to suffer something worse than death, weighs on her soul so drastically that it becomes a central part of the story because it becomes a part of her. This toxic guilt causes her spiritual death. She becomes very depressed and stops caring about herself.  Not only has she failed humanity multiple times over, but she has failed an individual, and one that loved her, in such a dark way. Her mind becomes filled with darkness.<br/><br/>This is not an uplifting novel in tone. Her story compounds the bleakness of—again, massive spoilers—the destruction of almost all humankind towards the end of the book. The glimmer of hope is that Cheng Xin and her friend AA escape the destruction of the Solar System. They go out to meet Tianming at the star that he bought her. <br/><br/>But let me go back just a moment, because I just skipped over the most fascinating part of the story. Tianming is captured by the Trisolarans and they don’t torture him to death. They build a farm for him (using seeds that Cheng Xin packed for him) so he can grow his own food and live there and they can study him and learn from him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the main plot, Trisolaris gains the upper hand over Earth, and then Earth broadcasts the coordinates of Trisolaris (and by extension Earth). Now both civilizations need to flee their solar systems in search of a different home before the Dark Forest strikes arrive.<br/><br/>But before the Trisolaran ambassador leaves Earth, she permits Luo Ji one question that they will answer, because of their great respect for him. And the question he asks is very insightful: is there a safety message one can post to the universe that would make others think we are harmless and cause them to not target Earth with a dark forest strike?<br/><br/>The answer comes back: yes.<br/><br/>But Trisolaris will give absolutely no more information than that. They don’t want to help humanity.<br/><br/>Scientists, politicians, and people of all sorts try to imagine what such a safety broadcast would be and conclude that whatever it is, we have no idea what it would be and it must be beyond our current technology level. Humanity seems to be at an impasse.<br/><br/>But then comes the most interesting part. The Trisolarans grant Cheng Xin a request to have a conversation with Tianming in real-time across space via sophons. This conversation is humanity’s big chance to learn something from Tianming about the secrets that the Trisolarans are keeping back from them.<br/><br/>The way the conversation is conducted is fascinating. The Trisolarans don’t want any sensitive information transmitted so they rig up a system with green light, a yellow light, and a red light. The yellow light warns them when they start talking about topics that could lead to sensitive information. If any sensitive information is exchanged, the red light lights up and both of them are exterminated immediately so that Cheng Xin cannot convey that information to Earth’s government.<br/><br/>Tianming does something brilliant and embeds all the information they need into three short fairy tale stories, which are reproduced in full in the book.<br/><br/>It was an awesome, scintillating task for me to try to decode these puzzles. You gave me, the reader, a chance to decode fairy tales that have embedded cosmological truths that just might save humanity!?!? Wow. I’ve never had such a thrill when reading.<br/><br/>I got a couple details right but eventually gave up on trying to decode the entire thing. I went ahead and kept reading to find out what the stories represent. But this was easily the best part of the book, and not because there’s a lack of other awesome parts! It was so incredibly fun.<br/><br/>Humanity goes about trying to solve these questions. The solving of these stories is in itself a fascinating story, which I won’t try to reproduce here. But suffice it to say, I absolutely loved this plot in the later half of the book. Solving these stories is the key to everything.<br/><br/>Without getting into all the details of the ending, but basically, even though the stories are decoded, humanity is not ultimately saved in time. Everyone in the human race is obliterated except for a small handful.<br/><br/>Yeah. It’s hard for that kind of ending to not take the wind out of your sails, and I must say I was surprised by this. I thought the trilogy was going to have a happy ending. I think this will be a tough pill for most readers to swallow.<br/><br/>But personally, I have managed to recover. In an odd way it’s almost refreshing to have some stories that surprise me by ending in tragedy occasionally; else how could I ever feel surprised? How could I ever read anything and believe that the good guys could really loose? So I can appreciate the move.<br/><br/>And life is simply this way: things don’t always go the way they “should” or we want them to, regardless of all our heroic efforts to the contrary. Life can just be that way, and reconciling ourselves to that fact is one of the great struggles in a man’s, or woman’s life.<br/><br/>As I’ve settled into reflecting on the book the last few days, what’s been interesting is that the sad ending is overshadowed by the fact of how intriguing the book’s ideas are and how amazingly imaginative the series is.<br/><br/>It’s imaginative in a rather unique way. Cixin Liu has taken the laws of physics, as well as some of the mysteries of physics, and used them to spin entire worlds, plots, politics, and conspiracies out of them. It’s so imaginative and intriguing.<br/><br/>Some would use the word “far-fetched” in a derogatory way about this book, but I wouldn’t, because the areas explored are based on the more intriguing parts of physics which are wild crazy things that feel like they “shouldn’t” be true: the fact that light’s speed is a constant, the facts of quantum mechanics and how particles behave differently when observed. All of this feels totally far-fetched, but it’s bedrock science. And so speculations based on trying to explain these things are, well…imaginative in a healthy way.<br/><br/>Same goes for the sociologist questions related to Fermi’s Paradox. Isn’t such a fundamentally important question (“where are the aliens?”) worth exploring from a sociological perspective? I think it really is. And that’s the beauty of these books. It explores questions of great existential importance to humans and does so in ways that are based off of science and logical reasoning.<br/><br/>And really, you can’t beat this unique blend of hard science fiction, imagination and wonder, conspiracy theory, perspective of someone who grew up in Communist China, lots of tension and huge stakes and reversals that make it intriguing the whole time, and just some of the most interesting ideas out there in science fiction when it comes to answering important questions with science.<br/><br/>Just one of the many intriguing ideas to talk about is the metaphor of the Universe being a great paraplegic because of the speed of light limiting any information going from one area to the other, and that being exacerbated by the fact that the Universe keeps expanding.<br/><br/>Oh and can I just talk about the fact that FINALLY we have a book where it’s largely not just Americans leading the way in saving the Earth from the aliens? In these books there’s a clear Chinese bias but I’m all for it. Anything but just every single book being USA = “the world” is nice, please and thank you. So that’s a nice bonus.<br/><br/>There’s so many things I don’t have time to talk about. But I’d recommend this series to practically anyone who enjoys reading science fiction with one caveat: can you get over not having a happy ending? If you can remain open to a book being amazing without having a happy ending, then read it.<br/><br/>Personally, I can’t wait to read more literature by Liu or in his universe. My research turned up the fact that while this is a complete trilogy, there is an additional stand-alone novel written in this universe by a different author, with Liu’s blessing. <br/><br/>It’s called the Redemption of Time, and it delves into Tianming’s story more, revealing what it was like for him being taken in by the Trisolarans and what happens to him later. He gets embroiled into a far future war between them and even more powerful galaxy-spanning aliens. Honestly it sounds really awesome. I’m looking forward to reading it.<br/><br/>I love these books.",,,1,0

In addition, imagine they limit themselves from receiving any financial outside help. And they have a thing for anonymity, where they never share their names with press or on TV, etc., a veritable nightmare from a PR perspective. Further, they have basically no money and their only source of income is sales from a couple of books.<br/><br/>Despite these limitations, they want to spark a world-wide revolution. How crazy does this proposal sound?<br/><br/>But such an organization exists. AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) started in 1935 and has swept the globe and has about 2 million members—and that’s not even counting the myriad of other 12-step organizations that have al sprung out of AA: Narcotics Anonymous, Al-Anon, ACA, SA, OA, DA, GA…there are literally scores of them. Who knows how many people are in all the programs worldwide.<br/><br/>But how did such an organization come to be? And how did it spread under explosive growth and manage to not fall apart at the seams?<br/><br/>That’s what this book is about. I’m going to walk you through the contents of this book and relate my thoughts as we go along.<br/><br/>First they explain that the title (Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age) isn’t intended to mean that AA is all grown up now, but rather simply that they now NEED to grow up, that they are in a stage where they need to come out of their adolescence and mature. Good clarifying point.<br/><br/>The early history of AA is told in satisfying detail, including the Oxford Group, Bill W, Dr. Bob, relation to Bill Silkworth, and other people without whom AA wouldn’t exist. Sister Ignatia and Dr. Silkworth are particularly fascinating characters. Ebby was Bill W’s sponsor and relapsed continually after AA started. And yet somehow Bill didn’t.<br/><br/>Also, Bill W’s story is told in more detail, so that was fascinating. I found it very enthralling.<br/><br/>Then it goes into the burgeoning of AA and what that was like, the bewilderment of how fast it grew in just a few short years.<br/><br/>Then there’s a section that recounts the history of AA starting in a lot of different places around the world. It’s summarized in a way that makes it a bit hard to follow here, but later on the stories are told again and are much more engaging there.<br/><br/>After that there’s a deep dive into the history of how the traditions came to be, which actually is WAY more interesting than it sounds. <br/><br/>AA was really hard-up for funds and was growing so fast that there was a lot of chaos and threats from outside and in. There were people trying to turn AA into a for-profit thing or various professional schemes, hucksters, etc. Bill W himself actually pushed a scheme where they were going to open up hospitals and send out paid “missionaries” (that was his word for them) to different locations. Thankfully, the other AA’s shot him down. In hindsight, he was thankful that they did.<br/><br/>There’s also the story of John D. Rockefeller (yes, THAT one) who was really impressed with them and helped them out a lot, although not—as they initially were expecting—with (much) money. <br/><br/>You see, AA had already established a tradition of declining outside contributions. But after scads of trials with money, grinding poverty on the part of Bill W and others, etc., they came to the point of desperation where they were ready for Rockefeller to make them a sizable charitable donation and get them afloat. Long story short, he threw them a dinner party and let them avail themselves of his advisors, but he did NOT give them substantial money; John Rockefeller himself saw that it was important that AA remain always self-supporting. Really fascinating story.<br/><br/>And AA ended up embracing that stance really hardcore, declining any and all outside contributions even from people who wrote AA into their will, and even ensuring that they limit expenses to the very bare minimum for the express reason that they want to ensure they never have enough money for it to become a point of contention.<br/><br/>It’s hard for me to imagine another organization that purposefully limits itself from getting too much money for its own spiritual good!<br/><br/>There’s a lot of other stories about the early beginnings, centering around dire money problems and the printing of the AA book. The AA book was almost called The Way Out instead of Alcoholics Anonymous, but then they checked in with the library of congress and discovered that 12 other books already had that name.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of miracles with AA surviving despite their extreme self-imposed limitations re the traditions. Another tradition that was a self-imposed limitation after considerable trial and error was “attraction, not promotion.” They refused to break their anonymity and use the endorsements of famous celebrities who were in AA and other tactics like that. <br/><br/>And yet despite all of these severe limitations which seem crazy, they have found that they have actually received enthusiastic support from reporters and journalists and the like, sometimes even censoring AA members more than requested.<br/><br/>All I can say when I look at the history of AA is: look at what God has wrought. The existence of AA is plain miracle after miracle. It is my belief that the next great spiritual revival has already happened, it just didn’t look like what traditional denominations would have recognized as a revival. The revival is AA. If compared to other religions (for AA is best compared to a religion, in my opinion), AA’s progress is astounding. It was formed in 1937 and swept the globe, now in less than a hundred years there are millions of practitioners. <br/> <br/>I was also intrigued by just how self-sacrificial these early AAs could be with their time and money. Bill W and his wife had no job and dedicated themselves to helping other AAs despite the fact that they had no salary from AA for the first few years. They were evicted multiple times, had to be humbled to ask for help many times, etc. That’s an extreme level that I wonder if I would ever be willing to go to. It really makes me think about my own level of faith and willingness to do whatever it takes—literally, WHATEVER IT TAKES—to be free of my addiction. This is a really inspiring book.<br/><br/>It’s also really intriguing from the perspective of studying how an organization grows and functions, interesting because of how many of “the rules” it breaks, which I believe to be due to the fact that it is what Simon Sinek (Start With Why) would describe as a vision-based organization. Studying AA reveals some interesting principles. I’m connecting dots between this book and Start With Why and No Rules Rules and my own experiences working for Ramsey Solutions, another vision-based organization.<br/><br/>In no particular order, the principles I’m seeing…first: if you help enough people, then eventually you won’t have to worry about money.<br/><br/>Second: self-imposed limitations that align with your organization’s vision make things really painful in the short-term, but are necessary for long-term flourishing.<br/><br/>Another principle I’ve noticed from other books is that it’s really hard to keep it vision-based when the founder stops being in charge, but here’s where AA gets interesting. The founder floundered a lot and tried to break the rules which he had originally set down. But it worked for him to be accountable to peers who had also caught the vision. That’s a really unique pattern; normally it doesn’t work that way in other orgs and this to me is another miracle.<br/><br/>Submitting to the will of the group for making big decisions. That’s a tough thing. They made a lot of decisions by committee, which is a tough way to do it. Decisions on finances, enterprises, and the book, Alcoholics Anonymous. <br/><br/>Holy cow did they have a lot of disagreements about the book. He describes three different factions: the liberal faction, the conservative, and the atheists, each trying to pull in different directions. But eventually the version of the 12 steps in particular that they ended up with was, by Bill’s own admission, much stronger than if he had just ignored certain difficult factions and bulldozed ahead. <br/><br/>For instance the inclusion of the phrase “God as we understood him” in the steps and “Higher Power” instead of merely “God.” Bill reflects that he’s really happy in hindsight they made those changes because countless atheistic and agnostic AAs have said that they don’t think they could have accepted the steps and even begun the recovery journey if not for that wording.<br/><br/>There’s a lot in the book that are about the convention of 1955, when AA turned 20 years old (“came of age”) and after which this book was named. Essentially, after 20 years of AA, Bill W decided that it was high time that AA became fully democratic and handed the reigns over from the founders to the people. Starting with that convention, ever since, the general service board of AA has been elected by a worldwide convention of AA meetings. The shots were no longer to be called by Bill W and the founders that he appointed in AA’s beginnings.<br/><br/>To Bill W, this turning point was a big deal, and something he pushed for for a long time before it was adopted. The analogy he uses is that of a father whose child has come of age and is blessing his child to go forth and make his own decisions from here on out. Naturally, the father can’t help but give a few last parting admonitions, and this is his speech that is given in section III of the book, titled “Four O’Clock Sunday Afternoon.”<br/><br/>After that, there are speeches given by notable men of medicine who support AA. First up is Dr Bauer, president of the American Medical Association. Honestly his speech was forgettable.<br/><br/>I was much more interested in Dr. Harry Tiebout, the second medical speaker. He was a psychiatrist who gave his account of having worked with alcoholics for quite some time, trying to crack the code of how to cure them, before he came across one that went to AA and was apparently cured. <br/><br/>Tiebout studied how AA worked and then tested out his theories on his clients, continually refining his theories as his understanding grew. I myself rather enjoyed this story; he seems like someone who had a truly entrepreneurial and open mindset, who was willing to try anything and continually revise his theories to figure out what would work.<br/><br/>The fifth section is notable clergy who supported AA, and was much more interesting than I thought it would be. First off you have Father Ed of the Jesuit order, who established the first Catholic AA meetings, and this guy is just awesome…self-deprecating, funny, the kind of guy I think I could see myself having a beer with. And he has a section in here about how just as man has his 12 steps to reach God, God has his own 12 steps to reach man, which includes sending his Son to die for us, etc. He also reads a poem called The Hound of Heaven.<br/><br/>The final speaker is Sam Shoemaker, who was the founder of the Oxford Group out of which AA sprung. Interestingly enough, elsewhere in this book it describes how AA dropped some of the more overtly religious and autocratic trappings of the Oxford Group, and Sam Shoemaker himself was immensely proud of AA and in his speech talks more favorably of AA than his own Oxford Group, which he references as having fallen in some way, although he doesn’t explain what he means by that. Very interesting coming from the founder of the whole movement. It seems he was so humble as to be able to admit that when AA took parts of the Oxford Group and added others, AA improved on it.<br/><br/>He also has the banger line that we should “Stop asking God to do what [we] want, and begin to try to find out what it is that God wants.”<br/><br/>One of the things Shoemaker emphasizes is a different kind of faith, not a faith based on dogma, but experience. This is one of the topics that I love because it’s something that deeply impressed me as well about the type of faith I experienced in a 12-step program. <br/><br/>Before coming into the program, I had all of these ideas (theology) about God (a lot of good that it did me). But the 12 steps taught me to re-evaluate my faith and form something more real. Incidentally, having read some philosophy since then, in particular David Hume, I believe that empirical evidence (experiments, things we experience) are in fact the highest form of knowledge. Who can deny what they themselves have experienced? I had an experience of God utterly changing my life and being saved from my addiction; that’s what I mark the beginning of my true faith. Thank God for Sam Shoemaker who started all this mess, although he had no idea the direction it would turn when he did! The Oxford Group had nothing to do with alcoholism and is now long gone, but AA lives on.<br/><br/>Section 6 is an address given by Bernard Smith, the (non-alcoholic) chairman of AA up until the handing over of the reigns. He handled the finances of the Alcoholic Foundation and was pivotal in several of the early stories of AA. Reading his speech here, where he shares his stories of how he got involved with Bill and AA, was revealing and he had some notable wisdom to share. <br/><br/>His speech closes out the official chapters of the book, and then there are several appendices, most of which I skipped, however there were two notable exceptions.<br/><br/>Appendix E:a is an article written by Bill Silkworth, the doctor who was so instrumental in helping Bill W understand the approach he needed to take with alcoholics to help them have the same spiritual experience that he had had. (Really, as you get into the story of AA, there are so many links in the chain without which the whole thing wouldn’t have worked.) <br/><br/>Silkworth mentions that half of alcoholics seem to recover using AA, and gives in his observation what the process of helping an alcoholic in AA seems to be, which I found enlightening.<br/><br/>He also says that the weakest approach one can make to an alcoholic is the typical intervention through family and friends; it has to come from another alcoholic and be when they are desperate and preferably while detoxing in a hospital.<br/><br/>Appendix E:b is an article by Tiebout, the psychiatrist, and includes a table showing the (estimated) numbers demonstrating the explosive growth of AA in early years.<br/><br/>He also has a great psychiatric description of an alcoholic’s personality, including narcissism and grandiosity. Ouch. He also says that about 10% of alcoholics appear to have the more dramatic variety of spiritual experience (blinding white light, etc.), and 90% the more gradual variety. <br/><br/>The book also has a few pictures, of course not of any members of AA, but of various friends of AA. There’s Dr Silkworth, Sister Ignatia, Dr. Tiebout, Sam Shoemaker, Dick Richardson, and a hilarious goofy picture of Father Ed. (I feel like I really would have liked that guy.) There’s also a picture of the convention of 1955 gathering, of a telegram from President Eisenhower, and a few notable locations.<br/><br/>I’m really glad I read this. The composition of the book could have been improved, but the contents were worth it. Some of the speeches at the convention had grandiose language that got repetitive, but one can forgive the speakers for their elation at having arrived at the point that AA had at that time.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone interested in the history of AA.",,,2,0

Civil Disobedience by Thoreau is a landmark essay and thoroughly rousing; essentially this is an abolitionist essay written in the period before the Civil War and demanded people to not merely vote with their conscience and be content to merely wait for the majority to agree with them at the ballot-box, but to instead take protestive action, to get themselves thrown in jail if necessary, to throw their bodies upon the machine that will not listen otherwise. <br/><br/>Action, action, action is called for. It's quite rousing and provocative and argues against the supposition that we should always meekly go along with ""the law"" of a nation, particularly when laws are unjust. “Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.”<br/><br/>The second essay, ""The Religion of the Future"" by Charles Eliot was entirely forgettable. It just reads as merely a list of what he personally wants to see in the future, not insightful as to reality, and most of the predictions have not turned out true at all. First he gives his credentials to impress us and then he makes a bunch of claims about what the religion of the future will be without giving any arguments, and seems to merely trust that we will believe them based on his credentials. Essentially he is making an argument by authority...and the value system of authority is one of the things he claims will no longer be present in the future...he seems to be unaware of the irony.<br/><br/>The third essay, ""On Going To Church"" by George Bernard Shaw was classic British satirical humor. It's the first time I've seen the unreliable narrator technique used in an essay. He is such a character. At the beginning of the essay you start to form the creeping suspicion that this guy is more interested in going to church for the architecture than for any actually religious reason. Halfway through that is confirmed in hilarious style. By the end of it you discover he's actually a really annoying tourist, going into churches and interrupting penitents and being rude and getting himself kicked out. It's very funny. He has a lot of opinions about ecclesiastical architecture.",,,1,0

I saw that this new work was historical fiction, different from the science fiction domain that he normally sticks to, but I hardly cared. Neal Stephenson could write about anything—absolutely anything—and I would be fascinated. His master of setting and character and their intertwining is remarkable and he just has this uncanny way of making everything he writes about so enthralling.<br/><br/>So I dove into this book with luster and I was not disappointed. The main protagonist Aurora is an interesting character, growing up half American and half communist agitator. Her parents emigrate to the Soviet Union when she's 3 or 4, but then they divorce a few years later and she doesn't see her mother for many years. She grows up in grueling poverty surrounded by people who are fanatics for the cause of Leninism before her story takes her back to America to conduct clandestine activities with her father.<br/><br/>The novel as a whole doesn't start with her childhood, however. It actually starts with Aurora as a young woman coming back to Russia after many years, working among other comrades in brutal conditions. His descriptions of the workers hacking away at a wall of ice that’s built up under the arm pit of this huge steel furnace is vivid and memorable. The brutal conditions are succinctly shown by them coming upon the body of a man who got caught out in the cold and whose body is frozen solid to the welding machine he was operating. When they try to free the body, it falls down into the furnace, which feels like a foreshadow of evil fates to come.<br/><br/>What comes next is the inevitable thing that all comrades must go through. Everyone has suspicion cast on them at some point; there is a great fear of spies and lots of political machinery is tied up in investigating everyone for being a potential mole or reactionary (read: western, anti-communist) spy.<br/><br/>But when Aurora's turn comes around to be interrogated, there are so many strange things about her peculiar story, that her interrogator is puzzled, and asks many questions. This gives the story a reason for Aurora to explain her life story up till that point, and is a framing story that starts off the novel in a compelling way. For a while the framing story is largely dropped, but towards the end it comes full circle and we get into some brutal scenes bordering on torture porn, albeit probably not unrealistic based on other stories I've heard of the era.<br/><br/>There's several impressive people in Aurora's life during her childhood in the USSR. Probably the most memorable is Veronica, the machine gunner in tall leather boots, with a commanding presence and brutal backstory. As a result, of the other comrades in their little community, Veronica has command of many unsafe situations that bewilder the other comrades. She's larger than life, impressive, and formidable, but her one soft spot is for Aurora. She is a counter-cultural example to Aurora at her most impressionable age of what it could look like to defy gender norms in this era.<br/><br/>An interesting theme that is pointed out a few times throughout the book is that in the 1930s and 40s, the USSR was probably the most progressive place in the world so far as challenging gender roles and letting women have any job they wished. The USSR provided more opportunities for women to break gender norms than America, in many ways. Many of the machine-gunners were woman, for instance. People argued that women were actually more adapt at this kind of warfare, likening it to running a sewing machine.<br/><br/>This early part of her story, during her childhood, is full of confusions and mind-warping ideas about communism, and I can't think of another example I've read that so acutely depicts what growing up in a radicalist type of environment would be like for a child. It’s heartbreaking to see little Aurora confused as a girl by all the things denied her in Russia because they’re “bourgeoise.” Playing ""cowboys and indians"" is bourgeoisie. Owning a comfortable chair is bourgeoisie. Having toys or nice clothing is probably bourgeoisie. Religion is bourgeoisie sentiment; traveling across the world to visit your dying mother is bourgeoisie sentiment.<br/><br/>And yet that is exactly what Aurora does when she is 18. She travels all the way to America, eventually meeting her mother in Chicago, but meeting a lot of her mother's anarchist people in the Northwest US first and working on a polo ranch there for a while. After her mother's death (which isn't really a spoiler; this is revealed early on in the novel), she teams up with her father again, joining a cell of communist agitators that are plotting to overthrow the American government in Washington DC for the sake of communist revolution.<br/><br/>My interest in this book doubled when George Patton shows up as our heroine's foil. General George Patton, as depicted by George C. Scott in the 1970 eponymous movie, is one of the more striking, vivid, memorable characters of all history. He was the best tank general the world has perhaps ever seen; historians argue that we may not have won against the Nazis without him. <br/><br/>Patton was as brilliant as he was controversial, enigmatic, romantic, politically incorrect, brash, and in a word: fascinating. One of his beliefs was that he was the reincarnation of Alexander the Great and many other great military leaders from history. His ego was boundless and he also epitomizes some of both the romantic and the toxic forms of masculinity, and yet--it would appear that in times of war, sometimes we need men just such as these in order for democracy to survive. I could write a whole essay about Patton; his story elucidates so much of the inherent conflict that liberal democracies must have with the strongmen that it must employ in order to survive. And unlike so many other strongmen, Patton is much more nuanced than being simply into his own selfish ends...but I must curb my enthusiasm and trim this tangent.<br/><br/>In this story, Patton is showing up earlier in his career before the days of WWII when he is elevated to a command second only to Eisenhower and God. This is pre-war, when he's just a young major, and this casts him in a different light than the movie Patton, showing his chivalrous, anachronistic side as he courts women and shows off in other ways. His role in this story is that he's onto the commies and he's going to root them out, and he provides an excellent foil to Aurora and her father's revolutionary schemes. <br/><br/>Set in pre-war America during the worst of the Depression, this book is an enthralling mixture of clandestine communist operations, scientific discoveries about cosmic rays, violent encounters with anti-communists, and the surprising connections the movement had with Chicago gangsters, post-Spanish War veterans, and--wait for it--polo.<br/><br/>Yes, polo is perhaps the most surprising aspect of the story, which explains the title ""Polostan:"" many works of historical fiction have been written about communism and leninism, but have you ever encountered one that details the movement's connection with cowboy anarchists in the Northwest United States and this group's affinity for polo?<br/><br/>On the face of it, nothing could be less communist than polo. Playing polo requires you to first, own a specialty breed of small, agile horse, second, train that horse to be okay with mallets swinging by their heads to whack balls around other horses cutting and jostling in close proximity, and thirdly, to invest considerable time and training to ride said horse and whack said mallets. A straightforward sport it is not. Bourgeoisie, much?<br/><br/>The people who played polo on the East Coast were usually high-ranking muckity-muck cavalry officers and, occasionally, their wives. Aurora gets herself associated with these people largely due to her polo expertise and helps them start a woman's club. This is viewed by her father as an act of infiltration and espionage, used to gain military insights useful to the communists as they plot their overthrow of the government in Washington, D.C. <br/><br/>But where did she get her polo expertise in the first place? The story covers this part of time as well, when Aurora travels from the USSR to America as an 18-yr-old in order to meet up with her mother, who is dying of cancer. Her mother is a part of the aforementioned cowboy anarchist's community, and we get to see a little of what that fascinating community is like in Montana and other Northwest states. It's really cool and I wish we spent more time there.<br/><br/>I'm not going to explore any more of how the plot develops because this book just hit the presses and I don't want to spoil anything. I will say that the ending was much more satisfying than I expected it to be. I'm also just impressed by how interesting he made this era, the scientific discoveries being made, and all manner of things that I previously knew nothing about. <br/><br/>This feels like one of those books that will stand the test of time and I will return to read again and again. I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wants to learn about a region of history you probably know little about, and enjoys well-crafted characters and plots. <br/><br/>Really, I don't know who shouldn't read this book, except perhaps people who insist on plots moving forward at blinding pace. I suppose the fastest plot it is not. But my interest never flagged for a second, because Stephenson is original, always fascinating, full of a plethora of interesting ideas and insights, and his characters are more real than life itself.

It started with making the case for why elimonating hurry is a spiritual discipline because after all can you imagine Jesus ever hurrying? It makes the case that we should read the gospels in a new light, not just ethical or theological, but read them as a biography, read them through asking the question how can I adopt a lifestyle more like Jesus so I can get the results he got? And it unpacks the verse about the paradox of the light yoke to explain how Jesus actually intended for us to do that.<br/><br/>Then a lot of the book goes through the different ways in which the modern life is all about hurry and stress and business and lust and materialism. This part wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great either to be honest because of course I already know all that. For me it was preaching to the choir. Nonetheless there was some great facts in there.<br/><br/>The last part has a really awesome list of practical suggestions to put this into action. Loved it.<br/><br/>This book is changing how I’m living and it has spurred so many conversations. It’s one of very few books that I would actually recommend to almost anyone.",,,2,0

I must say that while this was as much a pageturner as the other two, and while the ending was satisfying on some levels, it was also really a let down in some other areas. Spoilers throughout this review.<br/><br/>When it comes to showdowns with antagonists, it’s definitely satisfying. We get a big reveal about Brill, a guy who’s been showing up way too conveniently in all the wrong places to just be a shill.<br/><br/>We also have Ctuchik, the big bad that’s been alluded to repeatedly throughout the series and finally we meet him. Ctuchik is epic and I like that it was mostly Belgarath doing the heavy lifting of taking him down, not Garion. I don’t like it when the teenage protagonist solves all the world’s problems single-handedly.<br/><br/>There’s another big big baddie that is almost on par with a god; Taur Urgas, the king of the Cthol Murgos. I like that Taur Urgas is too powerful to be taken out; the author didn’t overplay his hand in terms of giving us a satisfying ending. There’s always another big baddie for future series.<br/><br/>My biggest problems with the wrap-up book is all the promises that were definitely not delivered. I felt the author made an implicit promise to the reader that Garion and Ce’Nedra were going to get married off at the end; and that didn’t happen. Nor did it even get addressed, really. It’s just left hanging there.<br/><br/>There was also an implicit promise in my mind that Garion was going to get more properly initiated into the magic, that we were going to learn the true nature of his unique abilities, and that he would come into his own as a sorcerer. I don’t feel like ANY of that happened. That’s probably the biggest letdown. It feels like the story is incomplete. That’s the payoff I’m looking for in a story like this.<br/><br/>It also felt to me like there was going to be a showdown with Torak, the evil god. These other gods show up, and the whole plot revolves around Torak being potentially awakened. It just seems obvious that he should then show up at some point. But in fact, he got no screentime (page time?).<br/><br/>And we didn’t learn enough about him; it feels like more should have been revealed. The plot revolves around him and yet I couldn’t tell you hardly anything about his personality except that he’s crippled and bent on revenge.<br/><br/>Same for the Murgos culture that worship Torak; we spent all this time traveling in their country but learned almost nothing about their worldview. Don’t they have anything valuable to teach us about the nature of the world like all the other races did?<br/><br/>The race of the Ulgos were very interesting but also underdeveloped. We never even get a description of what they look like or what makes them unique, when they are supposed to be the monsters and the most interesting people group out there. They are living underground and interacting with monsters for millenia; how has that changed them? I feel like we barely touched on that and they were underdeveloped compared to previous races.<br/><br/>Relg, the token Ulgo, was also probably the most annoying of all the characters in the party. He doesn’t really grow at all by the end.<br/><br/>Finally, the big epic showdown was crammed into the last 5% of the book. It was rushed, just like the other elements in the book.<br/><br/>I listed off all these complaints and yet it’s true that I mostly still enjoyed myself with this book. I can’t say it was all garbage or anything. Just a lot of unfulfilled promises that accumulate by the end of the trilogy.<br/><br/>As I do some searching online, I see that there are two more books in the series. Maybe the problem here is just that I thought this was a trilogy but it’s actually a five-book series? Is this the way it was originally planned? Because the book I have is packaged as a trilogy containing the books Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, and Magician’s Gambit. Curious if anyone else knows the history of this series and can fill me in.",,,1,0

It’s a classic setup, with a young boy with special gifts going on an adventure of epic proportions to save the world from impending darkness. I love the early childhood memories of Garion, or young hero, being in a kitchen with his Aunt Pol’s preternatural eye always catching him in the act of mischief.<br/><br/>And then he goes off on a quest with a group that reads like a classic RPG party: mysterious wizard, knavish rogue, huge barbarian with a sword, and a horse whisperer who is on his own personal quest of getting revenge on the evil people who murdered his family. <br/><br/>But if this all sounds too clichè, it’s actually done with a lot of twists and nuances. First off, the knavish rogue doesn’t just throw knives and pick locks; his actual main form of combat is tumbling / acrobatics, which is something I haven’t seen since, well…I can’t remember ever seeing it. It’s cool.<br/><br/>The other twist is that we have two mysterious wizards who are very much in contrast to each other. Not just different personalities and types of magic, but also the fact that one is a magician who Garion has known his whole life—or at least, he THOUGHT he knew her—his own Aunt Pol. Garion’s relationship with Aunt Pol is a big part of what gives the story an extra umph, because it burns him that the woman who raised him was concealing so much from him his whole life up until this point, and still insists on concealing as much as she can about the magic that she and he both have even though the cat is out of the bag.<br/><br/>But that relationship is also the thing that’s frustrating about the book and my main detractor. Their relationship stays stagnant for so long. Why does Aunt Pol so infuriatingly hide and defer revealing ANY information to Garion for SO long? Information about the magic, the world, what’s really going on, even just basic training for Garion as he flounders about with his magic…this continues into the second book as well and gets really old. That said, it does eventually start to change by the third book and so I’ve grown to forgive it. Mostly.<br/><br/>But seriously, it got old. The Polgara character needed more work. She’s not likable enough and sometimes is downright too nearsighted for a wise magician who has supposedly lived for thousands of years. Sometimes I feel the author was just trying to make her as annoying to Garion (and therefore to the reader) as possible and it was overplayed.<br/><br/>Belgarath, or “Mister Wolf” as Garion calls him, is a much more intriguing (and less infuriating) character. He and Polgara are like yin and yang. He’s the mysterious; she’s the mundane. He’s the visionary; she’s the practical. He’s the indulgent; she’s the restrained. He comes and goes like a vagabond; she is content to settle down as a cook and raise Garion. <br/><br/>Overall, I think it’s a great balancing factor to have the two of them and see their centuries-old interactions with each other. They have a relationship with a looooot of water under the bridge.<br/><br/>The Polgara thing aside…this was a wonderful book to read each night and made me very cozy and nostalgic for the fantasy books I read when I was a kid. This is a fine specimen of the classic high fantasy genre.<br/><br/>I think what makes it shine is the interactions between everyone in the party, the heckling, the idiosyncrasies and imperfections. Not a single character here is perfect, Belgarath included. But they are all endearing in their own ways and I’ll never forget them.",,,1,0

With its classic storyline, and protagonist who is a young boy going on an adventure with ancient magicians and discovering magic for himself, and its epic scope, expansive world, and Biblical references, it just has all the perfect vibes for me. It’s the best thing to scratch that Lord-of-the-Rings itch and yet still be undeniably distinct and original. <br/><br/>The best thing about this series is all of the different lands they travel through. In this book we get to see the land of the snake people, Nyssia, and encounter its queen, who tries to seduce our young hero Garion. <br/><br/>We also get to see Arendia, full of its chivalry and inequalities which is ridiculous and justly lampooned as the parody of medieval England that it clearly is.<br/><br/>We also see Tolnedra, the deeply corrupt and political, backstabbing country obsessed with money and intrigue, which I would guess is a parody of Rome.<br/><br/>Most importantly though, we get a new important character or two from each land. From Arendia, we get Mandorallen, the chivalric knight who is a bit one-dimensional, but I can forgive that because he does grow quite a bit by the end of this book and even more in the next one. He has more depth than he appears.<br/><br/>We also get to meet the patriotic Austurian archer, Lelldorin, who together with Mandorallen represent the two main factions in Arendia. Putting the two of them together in the party was a brilliant move. One is the old guard, and one is an insurrectionist. The contrast between them gives us great reason to explore all kinds of worldbuilding and backstory without it being boring, because it’s driven by conflict between the main characters and each other. <br/><br/>We also get the new character of Ce’Nedra, the Tolnedran who also starts off seeming like a one-dimensional spoiled princess, but also develops quite a bit.<br/><br/>While it’s a bit of a trope to have this love interest for our main character who is a girl who annoys him to death, I found it implemented in a way that was a bit more understanding than typical, because we actually got some scenes from her perspective that managed to humanize her, make her actions make more sense to us, and inject humor all at the same time.<br/><br/>Also in this book, I enjoyed seeing Silk, our scoundrel cum tumbler cum businessman, barter and haggle so hard that he leaves a wake of groaning merchants behind him wherever he goes. It’s cool to see all of his invented identities he has, and realizing how easy that would be to do in medieval times, where clothes and accessories are essentially the medieval equivalent of your driver’s license; those prove who you are. But what if you’re rich enough and clever enough to fake all that?<br/><br/>It does git a bit eye-rolley how often that Garion unwittingly gets confided in so that he alone can stop a nation from tearing itself apart. But this was pretty forgivable. Something about these books is just so cozy and warm that it’s like a sweet hot chocolate soothing the throat.<br/><br/>Also though, Polgara, why you gotta be that way. Garion already knows he’s a magician. Start training him more, seriously. What are you even thinking? That’s the one really annoying thing about this book. Thankful that gets fixed in the third one though.<br/><br/>I think this book is perfect for readers of fantasy who want a throw-back to the way the fantasy used to be written.",,,1,0

This is the continuation of Three Body Problem, in which (spoilers) we get introduced to alien lifeforms who are hatching a conspiracy to stifle human progress in any research being done into fundamental particles and a few other things so that we can’t have a huge scientific leap forward before they arrive to conquer earth in 500 years. The Dark Forest is the story of how humanity prepares to wage that war.<br/><br/>One interesting thing about preparing for something that will take twenty generations to accomplish is the problems of continuity. Thankfully, they have technology to freeze humans and re-awaken them at future times, and this is employed to send “reinforcements to the future” because they anticipate that as the preparations for the war goes on, defeatism will grow stronger and stronger and they will need their most loyal and positive-minded propagandists to be there in the future to assist.<br/><br/>This seems to be a clever way for the author to allow us to follow the same characters throughout the story, but it becomes much more than that…first of all, the future isn’t what they expected. They awaken to a veritable utopia: fusion drives have been perfected, energy concerns have gone away, there are huge megacities that are basically paradises…things have been going great and everyone is positive that humanity will win the war. The reinforcements seem to be completely unneeded.<br/><br/>However, one of the reinforcements starts being the target of countless assassination attempts. Hm, seems like the enemy thinks he still IS very important…you see, Luo Ji is one of four Wallfacers. What are Wallfacers? Well, as you know from the first novel, there is a problem. The enemy has these invisible sophons that can spy on all of humanity’s movements. Everything we do to prepare is under surveillance. What counter-intelligence can be employed in the face of such an extreme intelligence disadvantage?<br/><br/>Well, there is one place that the sophons can’t peek: the inner recesses of the mind. So the UN comes up with a scheme by which to grant massive amounts of funds to four Wallfacers, individuals who will never be questioned, and can carry out massive schemes, and are expected to try to deceive everyone as to what their true plan is. They are to keep their true schemes hidden in only the recesses of their minds, and they are expected—nay, encouraged—to actively deceive everyone as to what they are actually doing.<br/><br/>This creates some very interesting psychological interactions and social problems they have in their lives, which is explored in a very savory way.<br/><br/>In particular though, our main character Luo Ji is different from the other three in a couple ways. First, he is a sociologist. Second, he has zero aspirations in life. He doesn’t want to be a Wallfacer, and yet he is one. He only wants to live a happy life, not get entangled in grand affairs. He squanders his rights as a Wallfacer. It’s a very interesting path that the novel goes down for a while, and it’s interesting to see how it gets resolved. I could see some people being frustrated at the novel taking its time for a while with Luo Ji doing a lot of “nothing,” things that aren’t advancing the main plot, but for some reason I really enjoyed it. It was like an experiment in: if you had all the money and power in the world and wanted to just pursue happiness, what would you do? What would happen? Would it really work?<br/><br/>After that brief interlude, there is a character who interrupts Luo Ji’s stasis and forces him to change. It’s very sneakily done; I enjoyed it. Finally he gets on board. He starts much latter than the other three Wallfacers, and asks for much less funds. Many of his actions are mysterious even to the reader (they were to me at least). It’s neat to see how they later start to make more sense. The other three Wallfacers, by the way, each have their own subplots that get explored, and they too have sneaky things they do. Some of them. But for all of them, their plans come to naught.<br/><br/>I won’t give away how the novel ends, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single part of this from beginning through middle and through to the end, and I can’t wait to read the next one. Liu Cixin has such a way of blending massive amounts of well-thought-out futuristic ideas from physics, sociology, and so many fields into one comprehensive whole, that it’s just staggering. And he manages to also make a really compelling novel with plenty of mystery and memorable characters…I can’t put this stuff down.",,,1,0

The plot is that a girl in pre-war Paris has an encounter with a magical wooden ball that causes her to develop a condition where she cannot stay in the same place for more than a couple days without bleeding extensively. She has to stay on the move for the rest of her life or else she will die. This becomes something of an allegory for many things, although you’re not always sure what. Occasionally, it felt a little like a personal allegory, but for the most part it did not veer into that cesspool that the Alchemist started, and for that I’m very thankful.<br/><br/>In fact, for the most part, this story was quite engaging. There's something very understated about this writing style, deceptively simple, yet evocative, almost reading like a myth sometimes. The pages flew by, as Aubry traveled from place to place and encountered all kinds of people, some of whom try to rescue her, a few of whom try to kill her, but most of whom are merely baffled and intrigued. It’s a wide, wonderful world, and a mystery begins to develop halfway through, a place that is interconnected to the whole globe but that appears to have nothing to do with the magic ball. I won’t describe the place because I feel that would be telling too much, but it is enthralling to explore.<br/><br/>I waffled a lot on whether to rate this with three stars or four. It’s too bad because there’s a lot of things to like and even love about this book, a lot of things the author does really well. The plot line is simple and yet intriguing, and they explore every interesting nuance of the premise.<br/><br/>I love the scene where she ties herself to a bedpost, so intent on not allowing her disease to make her leave her friends for the thousandth time, and ending up a bloody mess, and having to be rescued and taken away from there by helping friends…the psychological pain she is in was very moving for me.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed a scene where she discovers she’s able to come home because it has so utterly changed in the last several decades that it’s no longer truly somewhere she’s been anymore…she’s a stranger in a strange land in her own hometown and with her own family.<br/><br/>There’s also something very free and easy way that the author transitions into scenes and moods that are nothing short of sublime. I really got into the aesthetic. There are some beautiful, grand passages, too.<br/><br/>And I love the profound, brooding passages. The only trouble with them is that occasionally a passage that was meant to be profound comes off as silly to me. But I don’t let that ruin the whole thing for me, that I could live with, that I understand: when you go for profound, you’re either going to hit it out of the park or slam it into the dirt.<br/><br/>No, there was really only one thing that really kept this from doing it for me. It’s that the protagonist is lacking depth.<br/><br/>At first I was carried by her charm, being a strong woman with a spear from Paris, traveling the world, seeing all kinds of things, having all manners of experiences…<br/><br/>But as time goes on, she, well…I just don’t see much of a character progression. It’s like she is all smoke and mirrors, a character built up larger than life because of her mystique and delicious name (Aubry Tourvel). The book itself plays on this theme for a chapter or two, exploring that truth: that people can seem like more than they are simply because they are exotic and unknown. The fact that the book calls out this theme and explores it a bit does it credit and helped redeem that problem.<br/><br/>And yet at the end of the day, I think I read more for character revealing and progression than anything else. That’s, just…what a book is supposed to be to me. Even with all the other things done well…it just falls short. A book all about one character needs to have that one character really be something.<br/><br/>Do I regret reading this? No. But I’m not sure if I would seek it out again. Maybe, maybe…it was a cozy read, perhaps good for those days when I simply want a retreat from my own problem-infested world, into adventure and wonder. I’ll certainly pay attention if this author publishes again.<br/><br/>So that’s that. Neither a ringing endorsement or a “run for the hills!” A decently good book. Probably would work well for many other readers, particularly ones who are drawn to wonder, travel, and magic and who appreciate deep ponderings. Not so much for those who want highly psychological character dives or who are just looking for nonstop action. I have a feeling it will do well with YA as well.<br/><br/>I received an ARC copy of this from NetGalley. I don’t think it has materially affected my review.",,,1,0

Say if you were a river biologist dedicated to restoring the rivers of earth in a post apocalyptic setting? And then you got the chance to travel back to ancient Mesopotamia and get river samples while fighting off the local Sumerians?<br/><br/>I love how original this premise feels. It's truly post-post-apocalyptic, where humanity is emerging from ""the hells"" and rebuilding the ecology of Earth, one dome at a time. There's a lot about how to restore river habitats. And how to restore the earth in general. <br/><br/>We talk about terraforming Mars or the Moon a lot, but I think the most likely terraforming project in the future will be to restore Earth after humanity has fully ravaged it. This is the first book I’ve read to really explore what that future might look like. It’s far future and they have super advanced (but conceivable) tech and they are doing huge projects of epic scales. It’s really cool.<br/><br/>But then there's a monkey-wrench thrown in: one of the big corporations has invented time travel, and that screws with everything because all the banks' funding dries up for ecological work.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a project manager. Never has project management and looking at data been so cool as in this book. As she bicycles over stunning vistas (with her six tentacled legs btw, lots of bio modding in this book), she has streams of data overlaid on mountain ranges for her inspection.<br/><br/>I love seeing the cultural differences between characters from different generations. It provides a different angle on relational dynamics.<br/><br/>I love the scenes where they are sampling a super diverse amount of things from the ancient Mesopotamian river biome while the locals try to kill them for being the foreign scary gods that they appear to be.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I love that this book has a great job of always balancing things so it constantly feels like you’re learning things about the world of the book and science, but there’s also always something going on plot wise that keeps things moving. Really great job at that. Whether it’s fleeing for their lives, working through relational dynamics, or getting into personal crises because of Minh messing with her endocrine system too much (which is a very interesting commentary on something I think it makes a lot of sense will be problematic in the future), there’s always something going on.<br/><br/>There’s also some ethics of colonialism stuff in here but again not just people sitting around pontificating; the conversations are a result of actions happening in the plot. This book is one of those awesome gems that makes it fun to learn and think and grow.<br/><br/>And it’s short, too. 200 pages. Really a marvel how much is fit into that space and it doesn’t even feel cramped or anything.<br/><br/>Although, I should mention one important miss. The ending. It literally feels like the last few pages are missing. We’re left in the lurch with a bunch of loose ends and unanswered questions. I wonder even if this book was meant to be longer and was one story split into two. But no sequel has been forthcoming. So I have to warn you about that. I’m more forgiving than most about structural issues like this, but I think a lot of people will be pissed about the lack of a very satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Just for fun, if you’ve read the book and want a more satisfying end. The ending that I choose to believe happens after the end of the book is…<br/><br/>Minh finds ways to use camera drones or others to take down Fabian. Or if she’s locked out, maybe he forgot to lock out Kiki or Hamit. They capsize the floating gurneys, killing Fabian and Susa in the process. Then, the king is really happy that they removed his nemesis Susa from the picture. He helps them build ships and go on the journey of a lifetime across the whole globe to get back to the island in the Pacific, where they escape back to the present. <br/><br/>They show the world what a monster Fabian and TERD (lol) are, the whole thing gets exposed in government investigations that reveal that time travel doesn’t work the way TERN says it does, the gov steps in and discovers ethical violations galore that amount to crimes against humanity. Time travel as a byproduct becomes open source technology and regulated by a government agency, which has its own problems, but at least it’s better than letting TERD do whatever the hell it wants.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and Minh informally adopts Kiki as the daughter she never had.

This series is shaping up to be one of my favorite space operas of all time.<br/><br/>We get all of the original cast of eclectic characters back, but now their paths all converge and they go on missions together—albeit reluctantly on the part of Moon Sostenti. <br/><br/>We pick up the plot of the war between the Hegemony and the Ansurrection. The war escalates explosively, and our ragtag group of friends are mere specks compared to the sheer magnitude of the events happening. And yet they take actions that affect the course of history, which isn’t unique in the space opera genre (which this undoubtedly is, although it’s notable for being a space opera epic where very little occurs in actual space). <br/><br/>But unlike in many other books, I actually buy that this group has such profound impact on the happenings of the universe (or the multiverse in this case). And it all boils down to Rupshi, the AI that Hadiz released from its programmed restraints, which can think freely for itself, for which a word is invented: untethered. <br/><br/>That fact is key because in the Pandominion, there are no untethered AIs. That is strictly verbotten, even more so now that they are at war with the machine hegemony, which is essentially one massive untethered AI.<br/><br/>And so Rupshi has a special status in the multiverse. She’s an untethered AI who is able to go after and procure massive resources and think deeply on different problems. She has an outsider’s perspective on the Pando, the Ansurrection, and the war, as well as everything else…<br/><br/>And now I’m being intentionally vague because in that “everything else” are a couple of very very key facts about the universe which has been mentioned before but ends up being key to understanding the history and future of the multiverse. <br/><br/>Gah! I struggled with whether to write this review with spoilers or not, but decided not to. Suffice it to say there is a lot of sheer awesomeness at the moment when Rupshi unlocks for them a really key understanding on the war that ties in previously mentioned fascinating details about the universe that now become extremely relevant. And Rupshi comes up with a way of solving the problem that only someone with an outsider’s perspective and a very creative mind would come up with. It’s the most exciting direction I could have thought of for the second book to go in.<br/><br/>Essentially, an apocalypse of such extreme proportions is coming that it is at an existentially profound scale. And only our group of “heroes” has a chance to stop it.<br/><br/>I put “heroes” in quotes because, and this leads me to another thing I love about this book, our cast is diverse in terms not just of biology and origins but also motives and personalities. I love that they aren’t all perfect paragons of virtue. Paz is cute and cuddly and endearing and very relatable, and arguably becomes the main protagonist in this story, but among the group are very selfish individuals who are also relatable in their own ways. I love just how amazingly diverse the viewpoints are of the main cast, which really adds to the effect of feeling that we are in a setting of grand scope, akin to Star Wars or the Expanse.<br/><br/>There’s also a sheer profusion of fascinating worldbuilding ideas in this series. Actually, I was disappointed to learn from Orbit’s site that this is the only other book that will be in this series. I really wish we got more books in this universe actually, in order to cover the breadth of ideas that are quickly touched on.<br/><br/>First, you have fascinating differences between machine intelligence and organic intelligence. For instance, one point that I love that they make is this: in the same way that biologic organisms struggle to believe that silicon-based organisms could be truly “alive,” silicon-based organisms struggle to believe that biologic organisms are truly alive. They would think of themselves as living, but why would they believe that we are actually living and not just the equivalent of advanced slime molds?<br/><br/>Second, you have the evolutionary origins of different sentient organic species being relevant to the plot and those things affect the cultures of those peoples and therefore how they interact with and view each other. For instance, I love how the implications of Pax's rabbit-like body is continually explored throughout the story. How would people see you differently if they were homonids and you weren't?<br/><br/>Third, you have machine intelligence being explored in multiple ways. What if AIs were joined into a hive mind? What if they were created by organic civilizations but then untethered? Or what if instead, they arose on their own with no prior knowledge of organic intelligences and had to figure out how to analyze them when they did? What might they think of us?<br/><br/>All of these and many more are touched on in a way that is very interesting, and yet it’s also only in passing as we go on the ride of the plot. Many of my favorite books are this way: this really intoxicating blend of worldbuilding and fast plot, this nice mix that’s not too fast, not too slow. Overall, I could stand for the pace to be just a little slower to explore even more of these fascinating thoughts MR Carey has on all of these topics that are of great interest to me. But it’s really delightful.<br/><br/>In summary, it’s really satisfying to see all of the main characters from the previous book now coming and working together on a grand mission. It’s satisfying to explore the most interesting parts of the multiverse and go in the most interesting directions. It’s epic and fun to have a romp across the multiverse while saving it all from certain destruction. The dialogue and interactions are pretty fun, and just about everything about this was delightful. The ending is epic on many levels.<br/><br/>So we could stop there. It’s really great; go out and buy it!<br/><br/>But if I’m nitpicking, the book isn’t perfect. The prose doesn’t impress. Also, I’m not completely satisfied with some of the character arcs which feel too sudden or black and white. And when interacting with a less advanced culture, or with some people group who plainly believes differently than the author, it sometimes feels as if they are painted as an ugly caricature.<br/><br/>And then there’s the pronoun thing, about which I have mixed feelings, and because of my peculiar type of nerdiness as an amateur linguist, I really want to divert to discuss. The normal review is over here, but stick around if you want to hear about linguistics.<br/><br/>In the book, they use a made-up pronoun, “et,” to refer to sentient artificial selves. Oh by the way, they use the word “self” when “person” would perfectly suffice. And “et” when “it” would perfectly suffice. Well, I say “perfectly suffice.” The point is made in the first book, Infinity Gate, that a machine consciousness would be very different from our own and using “it” denotes non-sentience. <br/><br/>Now, I do see his point, but at the same time, there’s really no reason that “it” couldn’t be co-opted to include sentient machine consciousnesses. And I like that option better, because no matter how many time this book uses the words “et,” “ets,” “etself,” etc., over and over, it just never comes to feel natural. It just rattles against the mind and sounds and feels weird, and therefore is a perpetual distraction.<br/><br/>There is an actual scientific reason for this. As someone who’s taken a few graduate-level linguistics classes, it reminds me of one of the interesting things about how the brain stores and processes language.<br/><br/>The brain divides all words into two types. Linguists call the first type “content words,” and they include nouns, adjectives, adverbs. “Cat,” “pretty,” “fast.” The second type they call “functional words,” and they include articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and—saliently to our discussion—pronouns.<br/><br/>Content words and functional words are stored in separate parts of the brain. It uses them differently. And if you think about it, it makes sense…in multiple ways, both from an evolutionary perspective as well as an efficiency standpoint.<br/><br/>You see, there are many animals that have a system of signals. When people say that bees have a language, or ants, etc., that’s not true. They don’t have true language, they have a limited set of signals, usually a small handful, with very specific meanings, and they aren’t able to really combine them together.<br/><br/>One of the definitions of language is the ability to combine words, to make an infinite amount of sentences—which we do spontaneously on the spot—as well as decode an infinite number of sentences, which we also do spontaneously on the spot. And the reason we can do that is the power of functional words. Functional words are basically the things that allow you to combine content words into complex thoughts.<br/><br/>Why did I go into that? Well, the brain not only stores these separately but processes them differently. Content words are easily added to the lexicon. Every year, scores of them are added to the global consciousness. Someone starts referring to pizza as “za,” and next thing you know, lots of people are. The brain is very accepting of new nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. For all intents and purposes, the amount of these in the human language is infinite—not in reality, mind you—but from the perspective of an individual speaker of a given language. You can spend your whole life learning new nouns every day and still never learn all the nouns in the English dictionary. The brain easily accepts new entries into these categories because it knows exactly what to do with them. It knows what you can do with something that’s a noun and furthermore, there are all kinds of subcategories of nouns. If I tell you a new color you didn’t know—fuchsia or what have you—it’s easy for you to immediately comprehend how to use that in sentences. It’s easy! You just use it in all the exact same ways that you would use blue, green, yellow.<br/><br/>But for functional words, it’s a different story. This is one of the key differences between the human brain and all other animal brains that we know of: we have functional words. And that is so key because each one of them is essentially like learning a new operator. By analogy, when you learned math, every new number you learned was just a new content word and learning it was trivial. But learning a new operator? Do you remember when you only knew how plus and minus worked, and then you had to learn how multiply and divide work? Or the exponent? Or integrals?<br/><br/>So, I have majorly digressed, but the point is this. The reason it feels so weird in your brain to try adapting to these new pronouns that various people try to proliferate is that your brain actually *does* react differently to them.<br/><br/>Pronouns are a type of functional word. You might think that pronouns are just a subset of nouns, but they really aren’t. Nouns always have a specific referent; only with pronouns the referent (the actual thing referred to) changes depending on context. If Levi and Bob are talking to each other and Levi says “I” he means Levi, but if Bob says it he means Bob. And “you” could mean all kinds of people, anyone so long as you are talking to them. Pronouns are essentially a way of combining conversational context (speaker/addressee/other) with noun-ness, gender, plurality, possessiveness, reflexiveness, and sentience (or whatever you want to call the distinction between “it” and the other pronouns). There is only a very small number of pronouns relative to the number of nouns, adjectives, or adverbs, and they are relatively static in English as well as all other known languages. <br/><br/>To be clear, every part of a language *does* change given enough time, but it has been shown that throughout the history of a language, functional words change orders of magnitude slower (or less frequently) than content words. Old English had another set of pronouns (thee, thy, thine, thineself) that have since been dropped. So pronouns can change given enough time. But it’s really rare.<br/><br/>This is mostly just a long observation, but if I had any “point” to this, I guess it would be this. If people want to be successful at changing the English language, they need to recognize the actual difficulties with getting something like that to change in the mass consciousness and approach the problem appropriately. It’s not going to be something that just easily catches on because one person started doing it, like “on fleek.” I don’t think it will be a single book that will a new pronoun change catch on. I think there would have to be a very coordinated if not centralized strategy.<br/><br/>Anyways. That really doesn’t majorly detract from the book, but I thought I would write it down and find out if it was interesting to anyone else besides me.",,,1,0

Cao Dai, founded in 1926 in Viet Nam as a fusion of Eastern and Western religious ideas, named Victor Hugo as one of their three founding prophets/saints. <br/><br/>One has to ask: what kind of books does one write that causes a religion to make him into a saint?? If you read Les Mis, I think it pretty well answers that question.<br/><br/>Hugo is so insightful about each topic he explores. For instance, when he talks about being in love, he talks about how you get lost in the other person and nothing exists outside of the present moment of doing nothing together. He so perfectly describes this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Or when he talks about the sweetness of revenge, he fully captures everything about that experience in such a way that you feel you are personally being intoxicated by revenge, that you are reminded of times when you were.<br/><br/>Or for instance, the feeling of being down-and-out, curb-stomped by society. The book has this heartbreaking part where Jean Valjean, the felon straight out of the pen, gets kicked out of every place, even the dog kennel. You can really, really feel for him. And then, the bishop takes him in. So impactful. And the scene where the Bishop ""buys"" Jean Valjean's soul by giving away his silver is better than any apologetic for the Christian faith.<br/><br/>Hugo has a way of making key character moments so incredibly pointed and powerful. He builds up tension really really well, sometimes dragging scenes out to be quite long in the process, but it’s every bit worth it.<br/><br/>The characters: you have Jean Valjean, a man who goes to prison for many years for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family. He is the central character who had a huge redemption arc and impacts so many other characters in remarkable ways.<br/><br/>You have Inspector Javert, a policeman who believes in the law in a way more reminiscent of religious fervor than anything else, and goes to any length to enforce it legalistically and brutally. His judgments extend even to his own mother’s sordid past.<br/><br/>I love this passage from Book 6, chapter X about Javert, when he thinks he has cornered Jean and enjoying the moment leading up to inevitably catching Jean.<br/><br/>“Knowing Valjean to be enclosed between the impasse on his right, the police agent on his left and the main party coming up behind him, Javert took a pinch of snuff. Then, with a demonic and sensual pleasure, he settled down to enjoy himself. He played his man knowing that he had him, deliberately postponing the climax, granting him a last illusion of freedom, relishing the situation like a spider with a fly buzzing in its web or a cat letting a mouse run between its paws—the ecstasy of watching those last struggles! His net was shrewdly cast, he could close it when he chose, and Valjean, desperate and dangerous though he was, could not hope to resist the force arrayed against him.”<br/><br/>So many amazing characters. You have Fantine, the young woman who goes into prostitution as a means to provide for her daughter, and has a sad life beaten down by the system. <br/><br/>And you have her daughter Cosette, who is one of the main characters, who is raised by Jean Valjean more than anyone else and is the epitome of innocence and beauty, completely unaware of her mother’s past.<br/><br/>“Cosette also became a different being, but without knowing it, poor child. She had been so young when her mother left her that she did not remember her. Like all children, like the tendrils of a vine reaching for something to cling to, she had looked for love, but she had not found it. They had all repulsed her, the Thenardiers, their children, and other children. They had been a dog which she had loved, but it had died. Apart from this, nothing had need her and no one had wanted her. The sad fact was that at the age of eight her heart had been cold and untouched, not through any fault of hers or because she lacked the capacity to love, but because there had been no possibility of loving. But now, from the first day they were together, everything in her that could think and feel went out to this man. She experienced something that she had never known before, a sense of unfolding.”<br/><br/>And then later, when she starts to become a woman, her character is such a new being and yet such a natural development at the same time.<br/><br/>“Knowing that she was beautiful she perceived, however indistinctly, that she was armed. Women play with their beauty like children with a knife, and sometimes cut themselves.”<br/><br/>And you have Marius Pontmercy, who falls in live with Cosette. Marius is a way more likable and fleshed-out character in the book than the movies. He has a backstory and his war-hero father and the whole subplot of him finding out his father was actually not a monster but a hero only just after his father had died was really tragic.<br/><br/>His father was a war hero who fought with Napoleon and was elevated by the emperor to the rank of colonel for his bravery and given the title of Baron. But after Napoleon’s fall, Pontmercy, like all the other veterans, are now treated shamefully, and are left destitute with nothing, no title, no land, no pension. Marius’s father, this war veteran, dies just about the time that Marius connects with his father for the first time, and this event sets up Marius’s story to become a part of the newest generation of revolutionaries and insurrectionists.<br/><br/>Will the new generation match up to the nobleness and grandeur of their fathers? And when Marius falls in love with Cosette, how will he choose between his two passions—her or the revolution?<br/><br/>And you have so many other characters, every one of them striking. For instance, the man who raises Marius and keeps him away from his father until Marius becomes of age is his uncle, Gillenormand, who is a hothead, an old guard yelling at the wind of new times, a classic picture of everything wrong with the old guard, the bourgeosie. And his aunt is yet another picture of a bourgeosie, but the softer side.<br/><br/>So many classic characters. I haven’t even talked about the priest who redeems Jean Valjean. Or the absolute scoundrel Thenardier who is a war profiteer and basically a profiteer off of any and all kinds of human misery. There is also a gang of convicts that get together for a heist and show the variety of different kinds of criminals.<br/><br/>There is also a section in an abbey where we see different kinds of nuns and how they are not all the same. Hugo never gives the impression that he simply stereotypes a type of person and plays that out in a two-dimensional way. In fact, I would say his superpower was really seeing people as they truly are, and dignifying (nearly) everyone, while not glossing over their flaws either.<br/><br/>You also have the ABC society, the group of revolutionaries that Marius gets together with, which again, this group has in it every type of revolutionary, from the hothead, to the eloquent, to the very earnest, to the lackadaisical. Marius getting together with the ABC society of revolutionary friends is an exhilarating time, reminding me of the play Hamilton.<br/><br/>But how does Marius fit in with them? I can relate to Marius’s deep isolation that comes from being caught between multiple groups of people with political beliefs I can't agree with.<br/><br/>Hugo is a master of making you FEEL things. For instance, the furtive dodging and hiding from Inspector Javert in Paris is so visceral because of the stakes: I feel like I desperately NEED Cosette to not be gobbled up by the jaws of the grotesque institution known as the French government.<br/><br/>Hugo is very insightful and profound as to so many things in life, such as the refining influence of a young man going through poverty.<br/><br/>“And he blesses God for having bestowed on him those two riches which the rich so often lack—work, which makes a man free, and thought, which makes him worthy of freedom.”<br/><br/>And there are so many insightful passages that I couldn’t even name them all. The insight that prayer joins two infinites. The concept of the eternal “now” of love. Or that “there is nothing else that matters in this world except love.” Or the illogic of nihilism. The theory that philosophy should be practicable. There’s even literary criticism in her, arguing that literature shouldn’t shy from the ugly. And there’s this amazing passage on how to truly live is to be in the great in-between.<br/><br/>So many things that you wouldn’t think of, counter-intuitive at first light, but when examined, it makes perfect sense. Real humans are paradoxical, and that’s what makes them so fascinating for me to study through authors who are really good at character studies.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the adaptations, I highly recommend reading the book, although it is huge, and yes there are diversions about the sewer systems and everything else.<br/><br/>But here’s the thing. First, the diversions are easily skippable. Second, the reason you really should read this, is that so many big moments pack a much larger punch in the book because there has been lead-up to it, backstory of characters, so that when characters have big moments, it totally makes sense why they would do that. I already mentioned the example of the bishop—because we get introduced to his remarkable character and the way he lives his life, it makes much more sense when we get to that famous pivotal scene where he lies to the police, telling them that Jean didn’t steal the silver from him.<br/><br/>Another example. Everyone knows the scene towards the end of the attempted revolution at the barricades. In the movies this scene feels almost like a random turn in the story. It’s like the story is happening and we’re following it, and then all of the sudden there’s a revolution going on…ok sure why not? In the book it is considerably more developed.<br/><br/>We have a whole chapter dedicated to show how the “ABC Society”, a group of young male revolutionaries (of whom Marius is but one) incubates. We meet several personalities representing different types of people who join a revolutionary group: Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Grantaire, Combeferre, Feuilly, Joly. You have ones who are ultra sincere, and one man who is just along for the ride almost as a matter of being entertained. You have one who is much more comical, ones who are more outgoing, one who is the catalytic leader, the one who writes manifestos. You get to know their idiosyncrasies and ways of talking and some of their motives.<br/><br/>And so it means a lot more later when they fight and (mostly) die at the barricades. It packs a powerful punch.<br/><br/>Also, you have more build-up to the attempted revolution through learning about the people of Fauberg-St. Germain, which essentially, this working-class group of factory people who are catalysts for so many of the french revolutionary moments are essentially a character in their own right. Throughout the story there is this building tension of all the people of Fauberg-St. Germain creating cartridges, organizing themselves into an independent cell system, distributing propaganda...something big is coming. The attempted revolution isn’t just an out of the blue thing, and we get a sense of the magnitude and importance of it<br/><br/>In fact, it’s enthralling to imagine a whole populace mobilizing to stage an insurrection against their corrupt government. What would that look like in a modern context?<br/><br/>And in the middle of the attempted revolution, when it becomes clear what’s going to happen, that they are going to be crushed at the barricade, it means a lot more. And when they realize there is an opportunity for four of them to escape by wearing these veteran’s uniforms they have stolen…I love how not a one of them wants to leave. They would all rather die than leave in shame.<br/><br/>That's so realistic to the odd ways men behave in social situations like that. It reminds me of what Tim O’Brien wrote about young men being too embarrassed to NOT go to war.<br/><br/>Also, there's just something really genuinely rousing about a group of people being willing to die for something they believe in. <br/><br/>I won’t give away the ending if you don’t know the story yet, but I will say that for a book that is best translated as “The Miserable People”, it’s remarkable how many people get a happy ending.<br/><br/>This book was a magnum opus, something I’d wanted to read for a long time, and the themes it tackles of grace, redemption, people’s ability for change, fatherness, and the insights into the true human condition make it an instant favorite on my bookshelf. In particular I can think of no better work of art for tackling the theme of grace.<br/><br/>I think this book is for anyone who can take that theme seriously, is willing to put some effort into reading, and loves rich reading experiences. It’s a nice bonus if you don’t mind learning about history, although not absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>If you are interested in reading something to give you an idea of the background of the French Revolution, I have two recommendations. The first would be for if you just want a really quick book, 3 hours long, that’s essentially an encyclopedia of important people and events in the French Revolutions. It’s simply called The French Revolution by Encyclopedia Brittanica and there’s an audiobook that is free with many library memberships.<br/><br/>The second, which is in much more depth but was one of the most engaging history books I’ve ever read, is A New World Begins, by Popkin. I’ve written a review of it here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5173621529<br/><br/>I feel this is one of the books that has enriched my experience of life the most.",,,1,0

The stories are in different settings, at different times.<br/><br/>The End of the Voyage - ****<br/>The first story is set in two places. At first it’s the global worldwide setting, and then the second part is on a spaceship as it watches the end of the world. It describes a plague that causes the infected to remain normal in almost every respect except one: they think it’s okay to eat humans. The story is written in a profoundly absurd manner, which I love. Something else that stands out is that the author uses an interesting technique of being intentionally vague about people’s names, country’s names, etc., referring only to one character as “this guy” and only to a particular country as “my country,” which has an interesting, detached effect. The story sags in the middle because it becomes progressively more horrific and predictable. But the last portion of the story takes another turn which I found satisfying.<br/><br/>The Center for Immortality Research - ****<br/>Another story is an office setting, a Korean institute for the study of immortality. It has a strong flavor of the Korean culture of honorifics, hierarchy, politeness, etc. It’s also an excellently plotted story with multiple twists. It capitalizes on what it feels like to be at the very bottom of an organization’s totem pole, and has a reveal at the end that causes you to re-evaluate the whole story in hindsight. I didn’t find the twist to be as sufficiently foreshadowed as it could have been, or its implications as fully explored and realized as I would have liked, but it was an excellent story nonetheless.<br/><br/>A Very Ordinary Marriage - ***<br/>A man becomes increasingly alarmed and suspicious of his wife making phone calls in the middle of the night and trying to cover it up. The truth he eventually discovers is horrifying, although it was certainly something predictable based on the tropes of the SF genre. I overall enjoyed the story, except the narrator was very hard to relate to; I couldn’t understand why he would act the way he did oftentimes.<br/><br/>Maria, Gratia Plena - ***<br/>A woman scans a criminal’s brain, searching for evidence of the criminal’s misdeeds in an ongoing investigation. As they go deeper into the person’s memories though, they discover the person’s backstory that caused them to become this kind of person. Excellent, excellent idea. Average execution. Would love to see more stories about this kind of concept.<br/><br/>Your Utopia - *****<br/>The title story is about a self driving car in the post-apocalypse. Humans have completely left the planet (which is never named but is probably Mars). The car, which is very accustomed to having human passengers in its back seat, is very discomfited and picks up a broken robot that has a vaguely humanoid shape. Named by the last three digits of its serial number, this broken robot, 347, is only able to utter the phrase “your utopia is…on a scale of 1 to 10.” 347’s original purpose is a mystery which gets unearthed by the end. The turning point of the story is when the protagonist of the story (the self driving car) sees a human waving in distress for help at the top of a parking garage and feels compelled to go investigate, despite the fact that there aren’t supposed to be any humans left. And despite the fact that at the time, did I mention, there is a giant pursuing it, a machine-amalgamating monstrosity? Shadows of the Colossus vibes. Bad-ass.<br/><br/>One More Kiss, Dear (AKA A Song for Sleep) - ****<br/>Another story is of an elevator and its relationship with an elderly woman who frequents it. There is an endearing moment when the woman reaches out to touch the elevator—something which no one has done in a really long time—and this really makes the elevator feel something that it hasn’t for any of its otherh occupants. The woman has Parkinson’s and the elevator endeavors to learn as much about the woman’s condition and how to help her as best it can. However, in a society where it appears to be normal for huge amounts of personal and consumer data to be stored and shared between devices, this woman is an outlier in that she greatly desires to not have her information shared and used for her benefit. And so the conflict of this story is that of a machine AI which deeply cares for this person, and yet every attempt it makes to be helpful is a privacy violation which greatly disturbs the woman…sometimes to disastrous consequences.<br/><br/>Seeds - ****<br/>Corporate lawyers land in a strange place where the living beings seem to be half-trees, half-humans. Or maybe just sentient trees; it isn’t clear. Basically, this story is a humorous jab at corporations and the lawyers they employ which don’t understand that nature could exist and do what it does without permits to do so. The best line of the story is essentially: “the sun doesn’t rise and set because you gave it a permit to do so.” Good story, but it made me irritated and mad—which, to be fair, was probably what the author was going for, so maybe objectively this story should be rated higher than I gave it. It’s really funny but in an outrageous way that makes you hurt because it’s true, things are almost this perverse already regarding the intersection between the law and nature.<br/><br/>To Meet Her - ***<br/>This really cranky old woman is narrating this story and essentially, her voice is just really funny. She keeps trying to go to events to meet this famous person, and there are terrorist attacks and other things preventing her. For most of the story, you don’t know why she wants to meet the person, but then you find out at the very end that the person is known for being an LGBTQ trailblazer in the military. That seems to kind of be important information and yet it’s withheld until the end, which makes this a much less satisfying read. Either the story is about that, or it isn’t. Either that information should be at the beginning of the story, or not in the story at all. The author does this kind of thing a couple other times in this collection, and that was one of the main things that majorly detracted from my enjoyment.<br/><br/>One thing that the author does which I have mixed feeling about is to populate a lot of her stories with mundane details. I can imagine that perhaps the point of this technique is to highlight the mundaneness of real life, but oftentimes it’s overdone for my taste and leaves me bored for long periods of time.<br/><br/>However there is a lot here that’s quite interesting. There’s a lot of fascinating ideas in terms of the intersection between medical technology and AI and how humans react to it. There’s also a remarkable number of machine intelligence protagonists, which I think is a needed direction for fiction to explore.

Massive spoilers in this review. But basically, the whole idea of discovering the ring that the alien intelligence built for them, and the three main factions of humans gathering around it, and then how it all unfolds with exploring the ring and finding all the other rings to the other civilizations…it’s all so mind-bendingly awesome that it boggles the mind.<br/><br/>I love learning about the ring and the mysterious “slow zone” station through the hallucination of Detective Miller: ""Doors and corners, kid...doors and corners."" And: ""So there was this unlicensed brothel down in sector 18…”<br/><br/>The first part of the story starts off nice and slow, and it's cathartic to see the crew of the Roci finally get a chance to rest a bit and enjoy the fruits of their labors before the next intense action sequence begins.<br/><br/>And that’s nice. But, and here’s my only main hangup with this book, the whole first quarter of the book continues to be slow because too many POV characters makes for a confusing time. With that said, as the story goes on, it all starts to converge and come together as everyone converges on the Ring.<br/><br/>I love how the Belters finally get their seat at the table in this book; they are growing up as an organized nation-state and participating jointly in huge events that will shape the history of mankind.<br/><br/>I love how they show that the Belter’s government, the OPA, has its origins more as a union or terrorist organization than anything else, and its culture is so distinct.<br/><br/>The addition of the character of Clarissa Mao is really brilliant for a few reasons. First, being in the mind of a character who is completely opposed to our main group of characters is really eye-opening. She could have just been cast as a typical villain, just a baddie with no soul. But instead we are made to actually feel for her, and while still believing that what she’s doing is bad…I found myself having empathy for her. I love that.<br/><br/>The addition of the character Anna Volovodov is also very interesting to me. Here you have a minister…someone you expect to be totally boring, but she’s implemented in such a way that we really find ourselves rooting for the minister who actually wants to make the world a batter place, the one who is more practical-minded who hasn’t forgotten that she’s here to help people, even as she swims in a shark tank of spiritual leaders who have all forgotten that because they’re enthralled with the quest for power, little better than the typical politicians.<br/><br/>And Anna is the perfect person to intercept Clarissa’s attempted acts of terrorism. It challenges her in unique ways. And also, I love that her intervening is what saves the crew of the Roci from destruction…not EVERYTHING is solved by our main characters, because after all, that’s not the way life is. Sometimes we need help.<br/><br/>It’s also very interesting to see how minister Anna interacts with the crew of the Roci. You have people with different worldview but because of life circumstances (such as Anna basically saving all their asses singlehandedly), they are beholden to her, and so give her the favor she asks, which is to “forgive” Clarissa Mao for trying to kill them all. Now that’s very interesting. <br/><br/>Another topic. It’s also very interesting to me how because of the alien intelligence choosing James Holden to speak to in visions of Miller, it essentially makes him out to be an even bigger megalomaniac than he really is. He ends up having to tell the rest of humanity: yeah, I’ve been seeing visions that are telling me that I alone have been called to the ring to unlock it. This turn of events is really interesting because 1) he gets unfairly judged for it, but also 2) does he not kind of deserve that unfair judgment? And 3) only certain types of people would follow visions telling them that there is secret truth that only they can unlock…if he wasn’t that kind of person, would the alien intelligence even have picked him? Or would it have picked him and been unable to do what needed to be done? Is it perhaps necessary that society has certain people in it with enough hubris to believe in themselves that much?<br/><br/>In short: lots of books have charismatic leaders with hero mentalities. But I don’t see the other books exploring the interesting questions around that archetype that the Expanse explores. It’s made me ask a lot of interesting questions.<br/><br/>One other word about the plot. I love that it’s basically the alien-created intelligence that is the adult in the situation, and the human factions are behaving like children. It's always humans who create the catastrophes that threaten the end of the world as we know it. Not the aliens. We want to blame the aliens. We are already blaming them before we've even discovered them, making all of these stories about aliens coming to invade Earth. But it's not them we have to worry about. It's us.",,,1,0

5297,The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,"Wilde, Oscar",Jeffrey Eugenides,"=""""","=""""",5,4.13,Random House: Modern Library,Paperback,272,2004,1890,2024/11/01,2023/12/14,enlightenment-classics,enlightenment-classics (#25),read,"Wow. Everything about this faustian story was an amazing ride.<br/><br/>First off, the beginning is absolutely fascinating. You have Dorian Gray, a perfectly innocent young man who God has gifted with extraordinary beauty, but hasn’t yet become self-conscious of it. You have Henry, the perfect embodiment of the devil, arguing quite eloquently for a new hedonism and corrupting him. And you have the artist Bazel, by which these other two meet.<br/><br/>Notice that the artist is the one person who is well acquainted with both the innocent and the devil. He seeks to shield one from the other but fails. And it is ironically his obsession with capturing beauty that causes Henry to meet Gray, and therefore Gray to become corrupted. That in and of itself has to be a deep metaphor.<br/><br/>There’s an exquisitely enjoyable dynamics between each pair of characters. It starts with Henry, the devil, interacting with the artist. It’s so funny to see people who are old friends interacting, but in this case they have a very asymmetric relationship; the artist recognizes the devil as being the corrupting influence he is, and yet is still friends with him. Meanwhile, Henry (the devil) enjoys the pleasures of the artist’s art but only from a sensual perspective, never valuing what is actually most valuable about that art, which is to say, its soul.<br/><br/>Then there’s the interactions between Henry and Dorian Gray. As he corrupts him, we are drawn into a sick fascination, as if watching a spider turn its prey from life to death. It’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but much sicker than that, because it’s a study in how to corrupt a young idealist, how to slowly warp his thinking into yours.<br/><br/>Henry has to be one of the most outstanding characters in all literature of all time. Never has a diabolical character been so convincing. I’m fascinated and impressed by his eloquence, his willful paradoxes, his soaring heights of perspective, his ability to cut through the marrow of life and bring together so many insights on the nature of men and life and living. Although I don’t agree with his main thrust of arguing towards hedonism, the fact is that in the process of him making his arguments, he says so many really, really good, quotable lines, that one can almost forget the source.<br/><br/>A few quotes follow. (Some of the following are paraphrases and as such are not in quotes.)<br/><br/>“The only cure for the soul is the senses, and the only cure for the senses is the soul.”<br/><br/>Beauty is a fact that needs no explanation, like the sun or the moonlight or a waterfall.<br/><br/>Forget about trying to make a moment last forever. The only difference between a caprice and the lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.<br/><br/>“I would have objected to it this morning,” said Dorian Gray.<br/>“This morning,” said Henry. “You have lived since then.”<br/><br/>Major spoilers to follow. The story is, of course, a profound tragedy. To see Dorian Gray start off so innocent and then to see him fall…oh, but for a while it is such a euphoric fall. I love a good old descent into madness. And if it's romantically aesthetic and morbid, so much the better! For a while it is so beautiful and intoxicating even. <br/><br/>But there’s a bitter sadness underlying it because we know where this is going. And as the story progresses towards the end, that sadness becomes stronger. The story culminates, of course, in Dorian coming very close to turning back to good, but then he commits a damning act, and plunges straight into perdition. The story ends, as any good tragedy has to, with his death.<br/><br/>The ending of this book progresses to the utmost logical extremes of Dorian’s newfound philosophy and the result is horrifying. It’s perfect in every way. I believe that great tragedies are great because they so perfectly illuminate, better than anything else, what we want to avoid at all costs in the most profound sense: moral decay, that falling that results in us regretting our entire life.<br/><br/>Stop everything. Read this beautiful, heart-rending book right now. And live differently for it.",,,1,0

Struggling to survive against a planet of sentient, thinking plants?<br/><br/>Semiosis shows the way that a new culture on a new planet changes throughout multiple generations.  The first generation is strongly idealistic, but each generation changes a bit in reaction to the previous generation, and in reaction to the environment.<br/><br/>The environment itself is the most interesting part, and is both the villain and sometimes an unlikely ally.  The new planet is a billion years older than earth and so the plant species have had more time to evolve, and many of the plants have varying levels of sentience.  A couple of them in particular are very intelligent, and in fact one of them is more intelligent than humans in some respects.  The novel is a good exploration of the question: what is intelligence?<br/><br/>As an aside, although in many ways this is hard-scifi-ish, one problem is that the book makes no attempt to explain how it is that these plants have such intelligence.  Plants as we understand them don't have nervous systems, so...it's a bit problematic I think to not have attempted to show how/why these plants are so fundamentally different from earth plants.<br/><br/>This book is not a traditional novel.  It is essentially a collection of short stories that happen to link together in time and affect each other. Each new generation of humans has a new human as the POV (point-of-view) character.  There is also frequent plant POV interspersed with the humans'.  <br/><br/>This is very interesting.  The writer made some distinct choices with how these plants think.  One of the criticisms I've seen of this novel is that one of the plants thinks in terms of chemicals a lot.  While this is not at all how we think, I think it was a good choice for the writer to have gone in a decidedly non-human direction with how these characters think.  After all, if they aren't fundamentally different from humans then what’s the point?<br/><br/>One point that I didn't care for was, the antagonist in the last story of the book...this antagonist didn't make any sense as a single person.  I got the sense that this person was simply a catch-all method for generating conflict.  Not good.<br/><br/>With that aside though, almost all of my experience reading this book was very good.  There are major discoveries that the humans make as the stories progress; I won't say what to save you from spoilers but each story is a very different kind of story.  The worldbuilding is excellent, the science and characters pretty decent, the pace is just right.  And most importantly, this is a novel I found refreshingly original.  I'm so tired of books that are completely uninspired, but this definitely took some risks and inspired wonder and contemplation.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, the reason I didn’t end up loving it was the lack of a central protagonist.  I think the author tried to do something ambitious and it just didn’t quite work for me. But I’m thankful for the innovations and thinking this may inform my own writings.",,,1,0

This is its grand theme, from page 1 to the end. It does so through several different stories that are part of a very cohesive larger story. This book is very long, and for many people this will detract, and I can also imagine many people not understanding why there are so many different characters and places explored. It made perfect sense to me however, as I was tracking the way Stephenson built up the concepts of his theme.<br/><br/>He starts off by developing the concept of qualia--what they are, where they come from, how they work--in the day-to-day experiences of Dodge, our main protagonist. Then Dodge dies (this isn't really a spoiler as it happens very soon), and we get the story of an unusual legal process involving the care of his remains so that he can be scanned and possibly, one day, made to live again. We have several different characters involved, and the reason why may not seem readily apparent, but I believe it was so that we could compare and contrast the different ethical ideas about death, whether humans have souls, and what is truly sacred.<br/><br/>The story then has a section about an enormous hoax that is played on the world, and then a section about a dysfunctional Ameristan that's cut off from reality, and then a section about Sophia coming into her own and how she came to boot up Dodge's brain and how that worked with the academics, the legals, the rich foundation, and the eugenics people, and then there's a section about Dodge's brain waking up, what that's like, how his reality gets created, and then you see how other brains coming into the system naturally want to glob onto what he has created (the groundwork for that was laid earlier by explaining how brains are truly not meant to exist in a vacuum, but with sensations hooked into it)...and that's just the first half of the book. The second half is a series of stories that mostly play out in Bit World, the new world that is created first by Dodge and then inhabited eventually by thousands, then millions, and then billions of people.<br/><br/>There's also a diversion we get early in the book that, at first glance, seems to not be very related. Dodge's niece Sophia takes a trip through Ameristan with some friends and discovers the way that some parts of America have developed now that everyone has individualized feeds that filter and alter their entire realities for what they respond to. I believe the purpose of this section is to show how self-modifying systems can get into extreme places that cause the brain to be completely disconnected from reality. In a system where the brain is able to alter what is presented to it as ""real"", however indirectly, a person's brain and beliefs can change drastically, and not only that, but these realities can be shared, and it doesn't necessarily have to be tied to anything real. This lays important groundwork for later on a conceptual level, although plot-wise, this section of the story does almost nothing.<br/><br/>When I say this book is vast, I mean it. It's nearly 900 pages and it's not always easy reading (although sometimes it certainly is very delightfully easy). I don't read as many longs books as short ones, but I believe this one is a magnum opus worth reading. I will say that Stephenson's weakness as a writer is conciseness. But I don't think he needs to be concise in terms of the number of stories he is weaving into the book, because for this deep topic it required groundwork to be continually laid and concepts to be built upon each other, and in order for that to be done in the format of an engaging story, it takes a long time. I relished this book on every level--emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and just the pure enjoyment of reading a wonderful story well told. My one criticism of his verbosity is at the level of sentences and paragraphs and chapters. He has a habit of starting off most scenes by describing the setting and background in great detail--even if the setting is just a boring conference room in an office building. This habit did not appear to help the plot or themes. But once you learn to skim these sections, the book is nigh perfect--or at least it was for me.<br/><br/>I didn't even mention some of the stories being told in this book, and there really is a whole pantheon of interesting characters. There's lots of worldbuilding that's related to mythology, but not in a way that is a turn-off when you don't know the reference, because all the important references are explained anyway.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved is the gradual creation of the world that you get to experience with Dodge and the others. There are maps in the book at regular intervals so you can see how the land develops. And the whole story just perfectly captures and conveys that wonderful process that happens in our minds when we create new worlds. I've never read a book that captured that for me like this one. None of them hold a candle in that regard. As a worldbuilder and designer of all kinds of systems, this aspect made the book very personal for me, furthering my enjoyment past all of the other reasons this was a good book.<br/><br/>I can't possibly summarize this book in an exhaustive way, so I will end by saying, it has been one of the best things I've read in the last year. I loved it and will now be looking into his other works with hopeful expectation.",,,1,0

I loved it.<br/><br/>The first part of the book takes place in Shadrapar, the last city on Earth. It’s millions of years in the future and the sun is bloated; dying, perhaps.<br/><br/>There is a recurring theme throughout the book of lost technology and information. There are a lot of archaeologists and scavengers and small factions of people who have knowledge that no one else has. There is also blatant corruption and devious political intrigue happening in the background. The culture of Shadrapar could be described as dystopian, but it’s so far in the future that things are almost unrecognizable (and wonderfully original in vibes). The one thing that is abundantly recognizable is the selfish human nature on all sides.<br/><br/>The second part of the book takes place on the prison barge that trawls the water between the city of Shadrapar and their destination, a prison island. The main character has been condemned to suffer. Just in traveling through the swamp and seeing the bizarre creatures that attack them, a lot is revealed about the planet.<br/><br/>Essentially, the planet is going through another phase of accelerated evolution, like the Cambrian Explosion. They theorize that the planet is trying all sorts of things to adapt to Earth’s changing conditions. Life is growing really fast and they encounter all kinds of unknown and dangerous things in the swamp, both in this section of the book, and again later. Not only are there all kinds of wonderfully horrifying monsters, but there are several species with varying degrees of sentience.<br/><br/>In addition, there are different human factions that are creating artificial humans of different kinds, and so between those and the sentient monsters there is a lot of interesting shades of intelligence and self-awareness, which gets really interesting.<br/><br/>The next part of the book, taking up the most pages, takes place on The Island, which is a floating prison in a swamp-jungle with no solid walls—just cane bars everywhere. No one has any privacy and monsters from the water come to prey on the prisoners in the lower levels. The prison exists to mine minerals from the water. The Island is floating, sustained by four huge pumps. There is a filtration system to remove living stuff from the water, and that stuff is made into a stew that is all the prisoners have to eat. The prisoners are also subject to the capricious whims of the Marshall, whose true name is never discovered, and who enjoys killing people for the sake of perceived order.<br/><br/>A bunch of people die every time you turn a page in this book. It’s a killfest. The prison culture has a complete disregard for the value of human life.<br/><br/>The book is largely about surviving prison, and all the brutalities of that. But there is also so much more. There is a whole part about developing psychic powers, there’s this last book of a famous evolutionist scholar who was imprisoned at the end of his life (the main character is set to the task of translating it), there is an underworld with an alternative government system, there’s SO MANY fascinating things in this book.<br/><br/>And most importantly, there is a veritable host of interesting characters, some of which seem to represent different aspects of humanity in an almost elemental way, but others of which are complex and nuanced.<br/><br/>This is a great book in so many ways. I realize not everyone enjoys reading about so much misery, but I do. Well, I mostly do. There was one catch for me. As it got to the end I developed a feeling that this book’s outlook on humanity was increasingly pessimistic. As if there isn’t anything good about humanity. Humans only do allegedly good things out of actually selfish reasons. Humanity has just screwed up and not done anything right. And humanity is just all dying; everyone’s going to die.<br/><br/>So the question formed in me, is this book’s tone meant to be just depressing and hopeless?<br/><br/>The answer to that is complex. On the one hand, everyone dying kind of makes sense with the theme, because after all, this is the story of the end of humanity, and the end of the world. It fits with the setting.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what about the fact that humans seem incapable of having any actual love and compassion for each other? As I thought carefully, I realized that might not be completely the case. There are some instances where you could argue either way. But I can’t think of a single instance where the author makes clear that someone did something truly altruistically. Or at least, where considerable doubt isn’t cast on them.<br/><br/>I whole-heartedly reject pessimism. I’ve experienced my fair share of selfish people doing evil things. But I’ve also gained some perspective of why people do evil things when they themselves don’t want to be evil. And I’ve also experienced a lot of people doing truly altruistic things when they “shouldn’t” have from a psychological perspective. Humanity has all the most beautiful things inside them as well, not just all the most ugly things.<br/><br/>But you could say, does this story have an element of the truth by representing humanity’s ugliness? Sure, an element. I just don’t think it’s very balanced. So that’s why I can’t really give this a perfect rating. It just doesn’t give me hope and seems to be lacking in some relational ways. Out of this entire host of characters, not one person really loves anyone? Ugh. It is mostly set in a prison, so there’s that.<br/><br/>But essentially, while I loved the world, the ideas, the variety of characters, the high kill count, and the prose in general, it’s the tone that didn’t land for me.<br/><br/>All the same, this is still a great book worth reading, so long as you can handle all the misery without it depressing you. It does have worlds of things to say about what is really human, the relationship between man and nature, and ideas about the end of the world. It is vast and varied in its exploration of its worldbuilding and despite its length I found it very engaging.<br/><br/>This is probably a book I will be rereading; it’s written well. I’m very grateful to the Tchaikovsky for having written it. He’s rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors.",,,1,0

He defines the difference between specialized AI and general AI, and explains why the former is burgeoning right now (several breakthroughs have been invented and are now being applied to many industries; we are in the ""age of implementation""), but why general AI is still a loooong way out. He also explains what machine learning is and why it's useful.<br/><br/>The first half of the book got a bit repetitive. There were several different examples of different companies and products in the US and China. There was a lot of comparison of how they did things differently. He supplements big-picture ideas with concrete examples from his own experience as a startup founder and VC funder, and this is all useful. However he tends to repeat his main points quite a bit, and at halfway through the book I was beginning to be worried by this.<br/><br/>However the second half really picked up for me. He goes into a few different directions. First he explains why there is a coming jobs crisis (and therefore crisis of meaning for humanity) and why it's different than when inventions  disrupted markets in the past. I think he makes very, very good points. He compiles a short list of the biggest disrupters in history and does a very condensed history lesson on them. Then he explains why it's different from even the biggest industry disrupters of history in both its scale and the speed at which it will happen. The numbers discussed by economists and other experts are very startling. And he explains, based on his extensive experience as a VC funder, where he disagrees with the assumptions of the economists, and I considered his points to be solid.<br/><br/>The book then takes a sharp unexpected (but very good!) turn when he tells his own personal life story: how he used to be all about maximizing financial and status success, and only putting minimal effort into his relationships with family and friends who weren't key to his ascending the ladder of ""success."" Then he was diagnosed with cancer, and began a journey of re-discovering what it truly means to be human. This part was very interesting and well-done, and ends up directly impacting the last chapters of the book, where he makes recommendations for addressing the crisis of meaning that predicts we will have in the coming unemployment crisis.<br/><br/>He spells out what the currently-recommended solutions are for the jobs/meaning crisis and then posits his own recommendations, which all feel spot-on to me. This is a topic I’ve spent quite a bit of time contemplating already and it was really satisfying to have someone else put to words what I’ve been wanting to.<br/><br/>He has so much depth when it comes to the human factors. He's a really unique combination of understanding technical factors, human factors, and how real businesses and government work. Only he could have written a book like this.<br/><br/>My only criticisms are that the first half was a bit repetitive, and personally, I would augment his recommendations in the last chapters a little. In my opinion the creative arts should be another path included in his list of job categories that we need to change our social contract around, and I think it's a mistake to leave those out.<br/><br/>With that being said...this is a really solid read I will be recommending to people. I'm very glad I read it. It has given me a lot of information and a lot of good theories for the world-building I'm doing for a set of sci-fi novels that I have been planning for some time.<br/><br/>Kai-Fu Lee has made a really important contribution to the global understanding of AI and has brought a human element to the discussion that could not be more important. I really applaud him for this work.",,,1,0

The thing that holds you back from writing. The thing that is endlessly creative, endlessly stubborn, that wants nothing more than for you to not write.

For you it could be painting, founding a non-profit, raising whole and healthy children, overcoming an addiction, engineering an invention, any number of things, but one thing is certain: it will be hard.<br/><br/>This book is written in many chapters and each chapter is one single page.

Supposedly a paradise until you look at the seedy underbelly; a glorious iteration on Huxley’s “Brave New World” types of culture.<br/><br/>Then you have the Idirans: three-legged predators in keratinous armor, large and imposing, savage and religious, and surprisingly wise in certain respects. The backdrop of the book is the ongoing war between the Idirans and the Culture, in which our protagonist Horza plays a critical role.<br/><br/>The plot mostly takes place on a planet that would have been a backwater of no note, except for that one of the Culture’s great “Minds” (an enormous AI of epic proportions and capabilities) crashes and hides there. Immediately a race is on for the Idirans to try and get access to this proprietary and technology that could change the tide of the war. So that’s the premise of the plot.<br/><br/>Along the way, there are epic space battles and huge cities and space ships and epic happenings in space and on strange planets and islands. There’s a cult and there’s some really grotesque things that happen; be warned. This is a book where you kind of hang onto the edge of your seat at certain points, so I won’t give away any major plot points except to say: this isn’t your fairy tale type of ending.<br/><br/>In fact, at the end of it, I was left wondering: what was the point of any of that? There isn’t a clear side to root for, and none of the protagonists are traditional heroes.<br/><br/>I had a hard time caring too much about the main character. The changer species is interesting, but Horza just seems…there’s nothing about him that drew me to him. He seemed mostly self-interested and logical. I didn’t get a sense of much heart or many endearing qualities or seeing much of his humanity. And at the end, he dies, so…it makes me wonder what was the whole point of his story at all?<br/><br/>It certainly doesn’t seem a happy ending for him. On the other hand, I can’t really label this a “tragedy” story; it just doesn’t have the tragedic arc. It seems there is no clear story arc for the story as a whole, because the same “meh” feeling is there for the other character arcs as well.<br/><br/>I found myself mostly rooting for Yelsin and Balvada (sp?). Yelsin dies in the end and Balvada goes into hibernation for hundreds of years, just to wake up and kill herself. Ok. Again, what’s the point?<br/><br/>Reading the book description again, I think the author’s point was probably an underlying nihilistic philosophy. Nothing matters, there is no meaning in life, and he wanted to write a story to reflect that. Unfortunately, that doesn’t make for good story-telling. I have read books that had a nihilistic theme to it but were still more satisfying to read.<br/><br/>Maybe the point was more the “war is hell” theme. With those books I’m usually looking for a survival story, where I’m rooting for the heroes to survive. This starts to feel like that, but, again, in the end everyone dies, so still—not very satisfying as a war story.<br/><br/>The worldbuilding was very interesting, plot points pretty original or at least nuanced, pace was fast enough for me. So this deserves a few stars for those things alone. I did finish it. I just…yeah. Not only am I unsure what the point of the story was, I’m unsure even what themes he was trying to get across. It seems muddled.<br/><br/>It reads almost like a history in some ways, like he’s trying to show all the complexities of a “real” historical account. I think he was going for a sense of realism (albeit while being science fiction set hundreds or thousands of years in the future). He succeeded at that.<br/><br/>But, while there were many of the technical requirements of a space opera (space battles, big space ships, huge planet-changing things happening, a motley crew…), it didn’t have any of the feeling of romanticism and magic that a space opera should have in my mind.<br/><br/>In summary, I would say it’s at least an interesting read if for the reason that it’s original if nothing else. Glad I read it once; probably won’t read it again. But since this is only the first published work of Iain Banks and the cultures are intriguing, I will probably continue at some point.",,,1,0

It's focused only on a girl and her father, presumably the very last humans alive on earth.<br/><br/>The wording ""girl and her father"" is intentional, as this is really more of the girl's story than her father’s, although he's a very important character. <br/><br/>It is a coming-of-age story, but not really like any that I've ever read, for one, because this story involves a large degree of physical isolation and loneliness, because the world is completely empty of a single other human being once her father dies. This is one of, if not the loneliest book I have read. It got me in touch with my feelings quick.<br/><br/>The first half of the book is essentially a different story than the second. There’s no discontinuity between the two halves or anything; chronologically yes it's one story. But the entire nature of the story completely changes halfway through when her father dies. And then the rest of the book is basically a survival story with a very important magical realism element, whereas the first half of the book is not either of those things.<br/><br/>The style of the book is very straightforward; no fancy sentences and few long words. It's a style that is hard to pull off correctly, but in my opinion this book nailed it on the head. Loved the style. It reads like a fairy tale or myth.<br/><br/>This book is so beautiful. It is a requiem for the end of humanity, for nature and its relationship with man and how nature will be here a long time after mankind leaves the scene. It's a very nature-centric book. It's a book of simply describing things beautifully. There are no morals. Things simply are. It is simply a story. It's a very quiet, almost solemn story. I felt more connected with my humanity and the earth, and I'm very glad this has been in my life.<br/><br/>It's a short read and probably different from anything else you've read. It's an easy read, in some ways quite simple, and yet somehow still has a literary, deep feel to it. It imparts a quietness to the soul that is valuable. I recommend it.",,,1,0

But, aside from the fact that I had to adjust my expectations, I enjoyed it greatly.<br/><br/>This is a farce. It’s clearly how romances are NOT supposed to go; there are set-ups and then an unexpected curve balls that makes you laugh.<br/><br/>The heroine is obsessed with low-brow novels and wants to see horror in every detail of this ancient abbey she is exploring. She is capital-R Romantic in a very realistic world where she looks a tad ridiculous. I could see myself in her.<br/><br/>She’s also socially awkward and often doesn’t know what to do; it’s all very comedic, a fun story. And by the end, we do still get a satisfying ending typical of a Jane Austen novel.<br/><br/>There is a lot of breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the reader. At first this jarred me, but I got used to it, especially because sometimes it was quite funny, although it wasn’t always used to comedic effect. Unfortunately, after a time it came to feel overdone for my tastes. That was the main detractor for me that caused this to drop a little in the ranks below Austen's other works.<br/><br/>Something very strange about this work is that it felt as if perhaps, just maybe, Austen was actually bending over backward to be critical of women in a way that would line up with chauvinistic values? I don't have the full context of how Austen thought, nor do I have the full benefit of understanding the culture of the Regency period in order to discern how certain comments and criticisms are meant to be taken. So take that with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>But there is still a lot here to love. The characterizations of several people, the way she subtly makes fun of everyone simply through characterizing them so well, etc. I'm very glad I read it and look forward to revisiting it throughout the years.",,,1,0

I would take an action then that I would probably not for any other book--I would stop him from reading it.<br/><br/>I would explain to him that, if he were to read it now, he would quickly grow bored with it and put it down, and perhaps as a result never return to it the rest of his life, and therefore never know an exquisite kind of joy, a pleasure completely ineffable, sublime, on a higher plane than the other pleasures of life, consuming them with its scope, because this work takes a certain pleasure, which is most like pleasure itself, a pleasure of taking certain things in our minds, such as the constructs of memory, love, consciousness, and human experience, and enjoying those pleasures themselves rather than merely the various manifestations of them.<br/><br/>(That was a Proustian sentence right there--not as elegant, but demonstrating the length. He was famous for valuing long sentences, painstakingly crafting them until they conveyed exactly what he wished, not a word more or less.)<br/><br/>I would tell my son, no, please, do not read it yet, please wait. Let the anticipation of it build itself up in your mind for years, and then, when you are ready, read it and experience what I experienced at 30, which I never could have experienced if I had read it at 15 or even 20. I want you to have that experience.<br/><br/>This book isn't for you if you get annoyed at books for not having a quick enough pace. One of the publishers that Proust submitted his manuscript turned it down, saying that his readers couldn't be bothered to read things where it takes 30 pages for the narrator to turn over in bed.<br/><br/>I find that quip humorous because it is true. This isn't a book about lots of things happening. This is a book about memory more than anything else, but also largely about love and about how we relate to experiences and people and ideas in our minds, and the differences between our conceptions of a thing or person and what that thing or person truly is.<br/><br/>I've never read anything like this. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever read. If you are a veteran reader and you haven't read this yet, you are about to encounter something powerful in its refinement, heady in its depth. Enjoy having your life changed. And if you want a recommendation of something to listen to while you read this, try the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes by Erik Satie. He was part of the same school of piano compositions as Debussy, and his music was highly esteemed by Marcel Proust.",,,1,0

That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it, it’s just that I can’t rave about it frothing at the mouth like I did for Hyperion.<br/><br/>The tale continues with the travelers but also we have a story in parallel about what is going on with the greater universe. We meet two of my favorite characters in this series. Meina Gladstone is the CEO of the Hegemony and a complex and fascinating character; there are some shocking revelations about her as the story goes on and in many respects I look up to her for her foresight, but it’s also not all good. She is a political leader worth studying.<br/><br/>Then there’s Joseph Severn, who is another cybrid of Keats (the character Johnny, from the first book, was also a cybrid of his). But Joseph Severn has dreams, dreams of the group of pilgrims on Hyperion that are actually reality. This turns out to be of major import to the plot, as CEO Gladstone is able to receive remote information on the happenings on Hyperion through him.<br/><br/>As expected, there are developments on the planet of Hyperion. Sol Weintraub’s daughter, Rachel, continues to age downward towards age zero, and that tension gets palpable by the end. We also learn more about the Shrike and about the identity of Monica, the mysterious woman from Colonel Kassad’s story. Likewise, the characters continue to die one by one in appalling ways.<br/><br/>And that story does have some rather satisfactory loose ends tied up by the end. It takes a while to get there, though, and there’s a lot of brooding and wondering about when the Shrike is going to turn up, and not being able to do anything about it but just worry about it. There’s lots of wandering around in storms and the group keeps getting separated. I found this story to sag in the middle but grow compelling towards the end.<br/><br/>Although even at the end, it never quite felt like absolutely everything was explained, such as the true nature of the Shrike.<br/><br/>But while that story is going, there’s a second story going on with CEO Gladstone, Joseph Severn, and the unfolding war with the Ousters. That story actually has quite the enjoyable, epic arc. It starts with utmost confidence in the war and ends in disaster of Biblical, epic scale.<br/><br/>And it turns out that that whole bit about the AI TechnoCore doing some weird stuff with a copy of Earth? And trying to invent the Ultimate Intelligence? That turns out to be pretty relevant. So I was glad to see that a lot of those things weren’t wasted. There was a point to some of those earlier stories with the original Hyperion book.<br/><br/>I felt like, once these two books are taken together, there definitely is an epic scope, there is a lot about it that is satisfying, but somehow the second book just didn’t feel as neatly wrapped up as the first. Still glad I read it, but I guess it’s hard to compare to the first book when it’s such a masterpiece.",,,1,0

Co.,",Unknown Binding,201,1986,1984,2024/08/07,2024/07/15,,,read,"I had a spiritual experience reading this book. I was talking to my therapist and he pressed this book into my hands, saying “this book is talking about what you’re talking about.” I have no idea what I was even talking about at the time. What I do know is that later, when I took an epic 30 day trip across the country with my wife, when I was casting about for which books to bring with me, this is one of the two I ended up grabbing, in part because of how small and portable it is. <br/><br/>And so there I was in all of these beautiful places—parking our camper van for the night in Red Rock Coulee in Alberta, or a parking lot just outside Yellowstone, or on a mountainside logging road overlooking Hungry Horse Reservoir in Montana, or on Shadow Mountain looking out at the Grand Tetons in Wyoming—and each night, I would settle into my bed next to my wife and crack open this book for a few pages.<br/><br/>And a few pages is all it ever took to have a spiritual experience. Chuck C, the guy who wrote* this book, experienced profound life change when he worked the AA program. When he first came in, he was too shy to even get a sponsor—he would just sidle up next to other people that were talking after a meeting and eavesdrop to gain wisdom from them and figure out how he needed to work the steps. While I haven’t done that, I can totally relate to the embarrassment to ask someone else to “sponsor” me—asking for help never came naturally to me either.<br/><br/>He was also quite the self-centered asshole when he came into the program. He had wrecked all of his relationships with others. His wife was filing for divorce, his kids wanted nothing to do with him, his boss told him that if he ever showed his face at work again he would throw him through the window. But something beautiful happened: he realized how thoroughly he had ruined his life and everything that mattered to him. And so he adopted an attitude of realizing that he had lost his “right” to anything. He told his wife and kids, I don’t have a right to be in relationship with you. But I want to do anything I can to help repair the debt I owe you, so I just ask that if there’s ever anything I can do for you, that you will let me know so I can do it. And he told his boss, hey, I know you said you would throw me out the window for showing up again, and I know I’ve lost my job. I don’t deserve it. But I owe a debt to the company. So, if you’ll let me, I’d like to just show up and work until the debt is paid, and after that I’ll clear out my desk and leave.<br/><br/>Years later: his wife still hasn’t divorced him, his kids all love having him in their lives, and he never got around to clearing out his desk. In fact, after working at that company (which he used to constantly complain about, before recovery) for many years, he ended up buying his boss out of the business and owning it and running it for decades. When he sold the business to retire, he said every one of the guys who worked for him cried—big, tough contractors who worked with their hands—they cried.<br/><br/>Some of his stories seem impossible to believe. But I actually believe him. Because I’ve seen the transformative, regenerative power of God at work in people’s lives before. I’ve seen it enough times that I can “smell it” so to speak, when someone tells me a story like this, I can “smell” when it’s not BS—it’s the real deal. I never knew Chuck C., but I’ve gotten to see some of these other recovery stories unfold before my very eyes.<br/><br/>So anyways, he adapts this attitude of radical surrender, surrendering having any “rights” to anything. And perhaps the most remarkable part of his story, to me anyways, is how he conducted business. Instead of trying to convince people to give him business, he instead went out looking for what he could do for others. He wouldn’t make them sign any contract up front. He would just do the best work he could for them, and afterward they would ask him for a bill, and he would say to just pay him whatever they thought it was worth. Or if they insisted, he would write up a bill, but he wouldn’t charge for his own mistakes. And yet the people he did business with would pay him more than he asked for. And over time what happened is, when someone wanted his services, they wouldn’t even create a bid for it. They would just say, Chuck is getting this job. They wouldn’t even let other contractors bid against him. This pissed off his competitors, who came to him to try to learn his secret for playing the game so well…he would tell them outright how he did things. But they wouldn’t or couldn’t ever believe him. They would say, “you can’t do business this way. You’re a damn liar.”<br/><br/>But again, as crazy as his stories sound, I actually believe it. That’s not the kind of thing that people make up; he has nothing to gain by making it up. And I’ve seen crazy things like that happen.<br/><br/>So anyways, I was reading this book every night and started praying, “Higher Power…what if I lived this way? I’m scared to…but…what if?” Living life in such a way that you’re thinking always about what you can do to help other people instead of yourself. It’s a tough pill to swallow. It’s hard to let go that utterly. And honestly, I don’t even know if I can, if I have enough willingness. But I’m intrigued enough that I think I’m going to try to live this way, just a little bit, one experiment at a time. I’ve already implemented it in one area—I won’t go into the details on it, but suffice it to say…it was actually quite the liberating experience. So far the results are that this way of life is really worth it. <br/><br/>Can I really apply it as radically as Chuck C did? Maybe not. But I don’t have to worry about that. Maybe I can try it just for today.<br/><br/>I just can’t capture all of the other nuggets of wisdom packed into this little book. It’s profound, transformative if you let it be. It’s not an impressive book—it’s just a transcript of a talk he gave at an AA retreat, not really edited to make it more readable or streamlined or anything. It’s very plain. But the words are life-giving. So how can I criticize and give it anything less than five stars when it’s impacted me so deeply?<br/><br/>*Technically he didn’t “write” it; this book is a transcript of a talk he gave.",,,1,0

It does so many things right without falling into so many pitfalls. I can tell the author has read a lot and really worked to produce something that both fulfills all of our desires for a classic epic fantasy tale, and yet feels distinct, beautiful, and original.<br/><br/>How can something be both classic and original at the same time?<br/><br/>It's classic because we have a hero who is orphaned at a young age, who then goes through epic travails for his coming-of-age, and becomes a man by the end of it. It has magic and action and adventure. He travels around this fantasy world and witnesses the inspiring, the mysterious, the monstrous.<br/><br/>And yet it's original. I can't remember the last time (ever, actually) that I read a fantasy book where the hero was a musician and a broke college student, constantly playing in an artist's bar and plying his magic to make a few pennies here and there to pay his way through college. So much of the plot revolves around money, and he has to track his money so meticulously, it's always on his mind, and I love it.<br/><br/>I also love the two magic systems. You have the magic of sympathy, which is a set of a few simple laws that can be easily understood but have a million applications. As the reader, I got to have a lot of fun really understanding the system and imagining the implications of this system on the world, seeing those play out, and then some. And a really cool thing was that he would get himself into certain predicaments and I would start imagining ""ooh, that's an interesting problem. With his magic, and the tools he has available, what could you do to solve this problem?"" And I would put the book down for a little bit and try to engineer the best solution I could, and then pick up the book and read and see what he came up with.<br/><br/>But then there's the second magic system: naming. Unlike the magic of sympathy, which is widely studied, for which there's a whole university that studies it, writes tomes on it, and builds up industry from it, the magic of naming is everything but. It is an ancient magic, and it is very poorly understood. It seems to have died out a long time ago, and no one knows how it works. It is mysterious, ethereal, elusive. All they know is that supposedly if you knew the true name of some substance (like earth, iron, or fire) then you could control that thing. The old books say that the most powerful of all names was the name of the wind.<br/><br/>There is one mad professor who has made it is project to discover how naming works, and our hero apprentices under him. The eccentric tasks he has him do, the lengths they go to, are really hilarious and interesting. A lot of the book centers around the discovering of this naming magic. While the magic of sympathy is a very functional thing that factors large into the plot, like perhaps the muscular system, by contrast, the magic of naming is like the soul of the book.<br/><br/>What more can I say without giving things away? This book feels very comfortable for me, reading as someone with a more scientific mind, who wants to understand how things work. I also really enjoy his eclecticism! You’ve got commentary on story itself throughout, you’ve got class and race, you’ve got love and action and adventure and science and magic and all that. Songs and plays and books are referenced throughout; he is a masterful world builder.<br/><br/>Probably the only troublesome thing is a bit of egoism in the main character. There is a sense of grandiosity in saying “oh yes, of course, our hero can do that too. Of course he’s also a master of this eighth thing in addition to the previous seven.” But that weakness is easily overlooked by all of the other things this book does so well.<br/><br/>One last thing. There are so many fantasy authors that fall short for me because what they don't have that I'm looking for is true beauty. That's the one thing Tolkien had that I find unmatched; others have better plot or characters or anything. But beauty and tone, that's what Tolkien has that I find unmatched. The beauty of his prose, and the beauty of his world.<br/><br/>And so I say that to say this...caveat, this book is in no way comparable to the Lord of the Rings; the two are quite distinct in many ways, but I must make one comparison. The Name of the Wind is the first book of fantasy that has restored that sense for me.",,,1,0

Humanity has achieved the ability to send a ship at 10% of the speed of light, but space is so vast, that even at that incredible speed, it takes about 500 years, or 20 generations, to reach their target destination, which is one of the closer stars to our solar system. This book chronicles the last two generations as they near their destination, and what happens when they get there.<br/><br/>That said…this is not the worldship book that you’re expecting. I’m going to massively violate spoilers in this review, because I think it would actually be really helpful to readers to know what kind of book you’re getting yourself into. You see, for me as a reader, if I read a book about a worldship traveling to a planet that they plan on terraforming and colonizing, I have a pretty big, solid expectation that what’s going to happen in the story is that they’re going to get there, terraform it, and colonize it and live there.<br/><br/>That is not what happens. This is a story not about success but rather about failure and why such a feat might fail, but not for the reasons you might assume. This is no straw man’s argument. This author has clearly done a ton of research on many topics. He gives the benefit of the doubt that we can solve the problem of being able to propel a spacecraft at a fraction of the speed of light, including the fact that in order for a particle collision at that speed would obliterate the ship: they’ve generated force fields to deal with that. <br/><br/>He's also thought through how we could solve all kinds of physics problems due to the Coriolis Effect, and due to the fact that halfway through the flight, the ship would have to start decelerating, and that would reverse the direction of all the G-forces.<br/><br/>He's also thought through how we might reasonably solve all kinds of problems with making a closed system work that enables us to transport a diverse biology, a microcosm of all the biomes on our planet.<br/><br/>In fact, the coolest part of this whole book to me is the just how freakin’ cool this worldship is. It has 24 biomes, arranged in 2 rings of 12 each. Each biome mirrors a particular biome on earth, complete with geological features, plants, water features, micro- and mega-fauna, artificial weather and sun movement patterns to simulate even the change in seasons during different parts of the year…it’s freaking incredible.<br/><br/>In addition, he's thought through problems with genetics, regression to the mean, all the problems with taking a really long journey that takes place over multiple generations...this is really well done high-brow hard sci-fi. It's fascinating to think through exactly how actual interstellar colonization would play out. Politics, sociology, engineering, economics, biology…it’s all here.<br/><br/>This is a coming-of-age story about Freya, the daughter of the chief engineer on this ship. Her mother (Devi) gets pulled into all the various crises that happen on the ship because she has great intuitive, creative debugging skills. She’s not an expert in everything but she’s wicked smart and she knows how to ask a lot of good questions. I’ve known people like this.<br/><br/>Freya isn’t drawn to engineering like her mother. But she’s a very curious child. When she reaches adulthood, she embarks on her “wanderjahr,” a concept they have invented in this culture whereby an 18-yr-old can travel around the ship and live in different biomes for a year, working in different areas, and learn to appreciate the ship and find their niche in society. When she embarks on hers, she also embarks on a project all of her own making. She makes it her mission to interview every person on the ship, asking them what they like, what they don’t like about their situation.<br/><br/>This device is kind of brilliant for multiple reasons. It’s a clever way of allowing us the reader to learn all about the ship without it being an infodump. It also plays into one of the author’s apparent goals for the book, which is to explore the sociology of how people in this kind of culture might interact. Without giving away even more of the plot, I’ll just say that societal breakdown, fracturing, and rebuilding is a key part of the plot, and Freya is one of the most important characters involved in that.<br/><br/>I would be remiss to not also mention that one of the main characters is an AI, who refers to itself as “Ship,” and is in charge of ensuring the success of the worldship’s mission. <br/><br/>In fact, Ship is one of the most interesting characters in the book. Devi (Freya’s mother as well as the chief engineer) ends up making Ship into her best friend early in the book. Devi is a bit of a misanthrope and prefers talking to the AI who can help her with all kinds of problems. She ends up indirectly “programing” the AI because of her relationship: she interacts with it more than any other human, and the AI is made such that its inputs influence who it becomes. One idea that Devi implants into the AI’s mind is the idea that they are probably cruising towards really hard times in the future, and it may become necessary for Ship to take action, to intervene in order to save them all. Ship has never intervened with anything the humans do, and this is tough for her to swallow.<br/><br/>This ends up being very vital to the plot because when society breaks down in chaos, they start threatening the ship’s critical systems, long story short, and so Ship exerts authoritarian controls in order to restore order and prevent catastrophe…but then this introduces a whole tension as Ship ends up needing to take sides in a war, no matter how hard Ship is trying to not take sides. No matter what Ship does, and no matter how democratically and fairly it does it, it benefits one side or another.<br/><br/>Anyways, suffice it to say that there are all kinds of questions explored in this book about AI: what makes a human a human? What’s the role of AI in relating to humans? What is autonomy? What is friendship, what are relationships? And others.<br/><br/>Ok, moving on from that. The most important thing to know about this book is that it isn’t the kind of worldship book that you are expecting. It’s all about showing what can go wrong, and ultimately, huge spoiler, but they encounter major problems with terraforming both of the planets they attempt it on (for very interesting reasons but I will skip over that for the sake of brevity) and, long story short, they actually decide to go back to Earth.<br/><br/>Yes, you read that right. Half of this book is about them making a return trip journey back to Earth, and about what that’s like when they come back. The fact that the plot was turning this direction was really, really hard for me to get behind at first. I was like: what!?!? That is literally the least interesting option they have in this circumstance. That is so lame. This book is about people traveling all the way for all these generations to get to this other system to colonize, and then…they’re just going to go back? Yes, for a hot minute, I was pissed. This book was not at all fulfilling my expectations as a reader, and that’s why I think it’s more fair to readers to let them know ahead of time where this plot is going. I, like many I imagine, am all gung-ho about let’s explore space! Let’s terraform! Let’s do life on other planets! That’s cool, that’s sexy, that’s what I want to see.<br/><br/>Or at least, that’s what I thought I wanted to see. I mean, I did want to see it. But what I hadn’t accounted for is: this author actually has something really interesting to say about why the people on a mission like this might want to go back.<br/><br/>Think about it: at the time that a mission like this departs Earth, everyone on that ship is gung-ho. They are all there because they want to be there, because they think it’s worth it to put themselves through anything in order to give humanity a chance at colonizing other systems. Okay, fine. But this journey is going to last 500 years. So, those people have children. Their children grow up, and their parents die. And they have children, and they have children, on and on for 20 generations. And the first generation chose this for the other 19 generations to follow them.<br/><br/>And as for all the people born into those 19 generations, what is their reality? Their reality is they grow up in a tiny microcosm of the vastness of Earth. They grow up in an environment where everyone must perform a key job; you don’t have the option to not participate in one of the mandatory jobs that must be done to keep the ship and its ecosystems running, because if EVERYTHING doesn’t go EXACTLY according to plan, the whole system crashes and everyone dies. On top of that, they are subject to all kinds of laws that would be considered authoritarian and onerous on Earth. They can’t have kids. The population of the ship has to be kept to tight specifications, and so only a few couples are given permits to have children in each generation. This ends up generating a lot of resentment, perhaps more than anything else, although there is a whole list of other restrictions they are subject to.<br/><br/>And not everyone shares the same vision about colonizing distant places. Ultimately, it’s easier to terraform our own planet Earth than to terraform distant places. And growing up with the knowledge that the rest of humanity back on Earth has all these freedoms that they don’t…that can be hard on a body.<br/><br/>The long story short is, this book explores the collective psyche of a people who were born into something they didn’t choose and resent it. When they come back to Earth, they confront the organizations that sent them out to begin with, and it’s at that point that the whole thesis or theme of the book comes out. You see Freya’s rage against the smugness of the people who sent them out, people who hand-wave at the fact that so many people have to die and suffer to reach their grand vision.<br/><br/>Another element that is explored is that there are evolutionary effects that are poorly understood at best that may turn out to be detrimental to these missions. One such effect is “regression to the mean:” if you handpick a group of the smartest, most talented and creative people to go on a trip and they all have babies, unfortunately, those babies don’t all turn out to be super geniuses. Over time, the population’s traits regress to the mean. People aren’t all these super geniuses at fixing all these highly, highly complex problems they encounter on the ship.<br/><br/>Another problem is that smaller organisms evolve faster than larger organisms. The effect of this is that all the microflora and microfauna adapt to the environment of the ship and mutate and change much faster than the things bigger than them. Humans, which are many orders of magnitude bigger than micro-organisms, basically don’t evolve at all on the timescale of 500 years, while in the mean time, all these viruses and diseases keep mutating and making all the people and their crops and animals sick all the time. New things evolve that can handle microgravity better and can feed off of water bubbles that hover in the air in this environment and all kinds of other weird conditions in a microgravity environment where electricity and water and essentially EVERYTHING behaves differently.<br/><br/>Okay, I’ve waxed way too eloquently at this point. I think you get an idea of this book. It’s an epic masterpiece, and I feel like I’m going to be referencing it many times in the future for my own worldbuilding as a writer. I feel bad for not quite being able to give it five stars, but the fact that I wasn’t at all prepared for the plot being so drastically different from what I expected is just a huge blow against it. In the future, when I re-read it I expect to enjoy it more because I know where it’s going.<br/><br/>If you want a hard sci-fi, truly rigorous, comprehensive and epic treatment of the idea of worldships, this is your book.",,,1,0

The setup is that the main character’s mother dies and he (Mersault) goes to her funeral, which is at the “home” (their equivalent of a nursing home) that he resorted to letting his mother live at because of his meager income.<br/><br/>You would think that having this death early on would be a fruitful ground to make the story interesting in a variety of ways. But instead it is made into the dullest affair one can imagine; mundane; everyday; no tension; no plot; no beautiful metaphors; in short he does absolutely nothing with this potentially powerful part of the story. At this stage, one can only wonder: what exactly is the point??<br/><br/>Life from Mersault’s point of view is dull. There’s nothing to draw myself to this aimless character and in fact the way he lets himself be pulled into doing despicable acts shows me he has zero moral compass; in fact he’s a despicable person because of this.<br/><br/>Why should I care about such a person? He’s the opposite of inspiring. <br/><br/>But then, halfway through the book, things majorly change. Huge spoilers, but the character commits a murder. That’s where the real plot takes off with an investigation, time adjusting to prison, and a trial that are all much more riveting. <br/><br/>It’s also where I finally realized that this book is a sketch of a character archetype: the modern young man who has had all meaning stripped from him by growing up in modern society and so has nothing to care about, no causes, nothing matters if he does or doesn’t do it.<br/><br/>The essence of the novel is about the existential angst that is the result of the fall of religion in society. For the atheist who has become completely disillusioned with not only the concept of God but of the ability to find meaning at all, how does one go on?<br/><br/>Our character, Mersault, doesn’t feel anything deeply at all, he has no shame, no fear, no guilt, no joy. And so the feelings he does have are: boredom, mild interest, curiosity, droll amusement. And this novel is meant to illustrate the absolute worst path that that listlessness can take one down, and asks the question: what happens when they are faced with the direst consequences? When he goes to prison and goes on trial and then is faced with execution, will this character change? Can these extreme circumstances finally push him into a place of finding some sort of meaning in life? Some sort of character growth?<br/><br/>That is at least one way of reading it. I also am aware that Albert Camus, the author, was a philosopher who created the philosophy of absurdism, which basically postulates an progression on from nihilism, an answer to the question of how to find meaning. Basically, absurdism is the idea that yes, you accept that life has no essential meaning and is random and hard, and then you respond to that by embracing the absurdism of finding meaning in something that has no meaning. Life is absurd; embrace it, and enjoy it anyway.<br/><br/>I felt that he explored this philosophy perhaps a bit more convincingly in The Plague. In The Stranger, he has a moment of feeling happy at the end that isn’t very well explicated, and that’s it—he then dies. So it’s hardly an inspiring rally call to make me want to be an absurdist.<br/><br/>Nevertheless this book does very succinctly illustrate the nihilistic problem and show the absurdist solution, if perhaps too briefly and abstrusely. <br/><br/>In summary, the second half is riveting, but I consider the main flaw of this book to be that for the first half, it takes way too long to be able to understand “what is the point of all this?”. I’m glad I read it. I might read it again because I suspect the first half of the book will be much better when I know where all of this is leading to.",,,1,0

Traditional storytelling uses tension/high stakes to drive the story, but if your goal is to help people fall asleep, you need other techniques.<br/>2. Those techniques are:<br/>    1. use vivid imagery, engaging all the senses,<br/>    2. use imagination, exploration, or a sense of wonder to drive the story,<br/>    3. focus on inner change in the character driven by meditation or reflection,<br/>    4. to add a hypnotic element, say certain phrases in your story (like “deeper and deeper” or “sleep” or “dreamed”, etc.) in an ever-so-slightly gentler tone of voice,<br/>    5. have your story’s peak be less drastic and occur earlier in the story and have a long gradual decline afterward, instead of holding off till the end for a very dramatic climax like most stories.<br/>3. You can take existing stories and modify them with the above techniques. Types of stories that work well for this method: guided meditations, “bedtime stories” (I believe he means fairy tales and children’s stories), nature stories, exploration/discovery stories, character-driven stories, and 2nd person stories.<br/>4. The following themes work well: personal growth, meeting a character’s unmet emotional needs, encouraging relationships/connection/friendships, and moralistic wisdom/insight messages.<br/>5. Research from surveying listeners:<br/>    1. Some listeners like ambience sounds in the background, but some prefer voice only.<br/>    2. Most listeners of sleep story channels/podcasts said they’d rather have long 45-60 minute stories because that way they don’t have to worry about whether the story will run out before they fall asleep.

But at one point he specifically says “I don’t know that much about how narrative works”…almost like a badge? It’s like bro, you are literally writing a book about how to tell narratives…and you are purposefully not learning about that discipline because…why? <br/><br/>I think he would really benefit from doing so, because there are many obvious things I saw in his stories: full of cliches, being abstract instead of specific, show don’t tell, wordiness, grammar and spelling errors, randomness of disjointed elements being thrown together (nor marrying character and plot properly), hitting the reader over the head with subtle-as-a-sledgehammer morals/messages, and basic prose things.<br/><br/>Basically, I wouldn’t take his advice generally on what makes a good story but there are some interesting techniques that he has to offer from his background in hypnosis and therapy provides some interesting techniques.",,,1,0

Ajax<br/><br/>I read this as basically the story about how a great, renowned person can have a great life, but then end it poorly if he allows himself to be eaten up by entitlement and a desire for revenge. Ajax goes literally insane at the end of his life, ends up committing degrading acts, and when he realizes what he has done, he (you guessed it) kills himself (as is mandatory in all Greek tragedies). Others are angry at him and briefly consider disrespecting his body (by not burying it) but, this is wrong to do even to one's enemies, and so they do consent to bury it. There is a really good peaceful bittersweet ending to how Ajax dies.<br/><br/>But with that said, I'm not going to go into as much detail on this play, mostly because I just want to get to the other three.<br/><br/>2. Women of Trachis<br/><br/>This should really have been called Deianeira. It's the story of the jilted wife, who has gotten older and lost some of the beauty of her youth, her husband (Heracles) is always away, and then (in this case) he sends home a recently captured younger woman, Iole, to be his new concubine (basically). Unfortunately, when Deianeira first meets Iole, she takes pity on Iole and promises to take good care of her, before realizing exactly who Iole is to her husband. She is a woman of her word though.<br/><br/>This is an under-told story, if I can make up that word. I'm surprised at how many good proto-feminist stories that Sophocles told. It really focuses on the pain of Deianeira and I found myself really feeling for her. I felt for Iole, too, who had no choice in the matter.<br/><br/>But then on top of that pain, Deianeira makes a mistake. She uses a supposed magic potion on her husband (indirectly, by applying it to part of a robe that she sends to Heracles to wear). However, when Heracles wears it and the potion comes into contact with his chest, it eats away at it and slowly kills him; it's literally eating his heart out. He thinks she intentionally tried to kill him. She discovers what has happened and that she was tricked by the person who gave her this ""magic potion,"" a centaur who was actually enacting a final act of vengeance when he gave it to her.<br/><br/>When she realizes what she has done (she has actually killed the very person that she was trying to draw close to her), she kills herself (as all Greek tragedies are mandated to end). This story just really strikes so close to home. This is a universal powerful truth. When we try to control others it usually backfires and we get the very opposite of what we wanted. It also burns especially to have insult added to injury because she was already in such a terrible position. To be so terribly treated by someone but to still love them and want them to love you--that's a hard thing that many people have experienced. I am filled with empathy for these stories.<br/><br/>These are the kind of stories that need to be told more. When I was a kid I was told the myths that appealed to boys/men, but there are myths that were written that appeal much more to the experience of girls/women. We need to bring this part of our cannon much more to the forefront, alongside the others.<br/><br/>3. Electra<br/><br/>This is one of the best stories that I have read of Sophocles so far. I say this despite the fact that Electra, the hero, is really quite un-empathetic in many ways. Her father, King Agamemnon, was murdered by her mother and her affair partner who then became her new husband afterwards. To add insult to injury, Electra has then had to live with her mother and step-father for years and years. She has never stopped grieving for her father, which has made them very angry with her, and she's almost never allowed to leave the house, etc.<br/><br/>She has been waiting all of these years for her brother to grow up in a distant city and then come back and avenge her father's death. The play is largely about that happening, and when he does get revenge on both perpetrators at the end, it's satisfying--although it's interesting, the revenge actually happens off camera: you hear it happening instead of seeing it, but somehow this only makes it more riveting. It actually feels like there are elements of horror in this play.<br/><br/>It has traces of Antigone. Again, you have a young woman who loves her brother greatly and who is grieving a family member who has been killed and disrespected, and continues to grieve them in the morally right way despite that having majorly negative consequences for herself. She's not as relatable as Antigone because she is still grieving after maybe 20 years or something, and one can see her being annoying about it. When her mother comes on scene and you hear about why she killed her husband, you actually start to relate to her mother a bit--although you still don't ""root"" for her, you are able to at least understand her perspective.<br/><br/>In fact, this play really doesn't have a ""side"" almost, even though there's the very obvious ""side"" of Electra and her brother Orestes getting revenge on Electra's mother and stepfather, at the same time, every single character is actually humanized, their perspective is shown in such a way that you can understand them a little. The stepfather is perhaps the least relatable. But you really get a taste of pretty much all of the characters. And when the revenge finally happens, it's not portrayed as some positive healing thing...I interpreted it as being portrayed as a horrific fact.<br/><br/>Electra shows a different side of herself when interacting with several different people. She's almost a series of reactions to other people. She doesn't change up through the end of the play; she never seems to come to the realization that revenge will not heal her.<br/><br/>All the same...it's hard to explain why, but there's just something about this play that is different. It's not a typical tragedy. But it's not really a celebration of revenge either. Electra's love of her brother Orestes is something appealing. It also has some of the best actual action of any of the plays, including a really good telling of a chariot race. It's funny how good that that mini-story is, because, that whole story is just fabricated to give the soon-to-be victims a misplaced sense of ease at thinking that Orestes has died (and so not guess the truth, which is that Orestes has actually come back to avenge his father on them this very day).<br/><br/>I will need to re-read this play a few times to understand why I liked it so much. I'm sorry I can't give better explanations as to why, yet.<br/><br/>4. Philoctetes<br/><br/>This guy was annoying because again, throwing a pity party, lame (which is why I don't enjoy the two Oedipus plays as much as I should). But there was more to this one. There is Philoctetes, whom Odysseus is trying to trick into coming back to help them with the Trojan war, or, failing that, to at least steal his magical bow (given to him by the gods). But there is a third character, Neoptolemus, who Odysseus uses to try and trick Philoctetes. <br/><br/>Neoptolemus is the more interesting character, he's younger but also jaded, he relates to Philoctetes a lot, and he changes his mind a couple of times and actually helps Philoctetes (by giving back his bow to him), even to their detriment, and respects Philoctetes' decision to still not help them. And he's willing to fight Odysseus and all the Greeks over this. He also tries to persuade Philoctetes, but he's not going to fight him to force his way. He seems much more motivated by empathy and much more capable of gaining perspective than any of the other Greek characters I've read about thus far. I really like him.<br/><br/>There's also a classic Ex Deus Machina at the end, a literal god-in-the-machine, as Heracles shows up in glory and convinces Philoctetes to go with them. Some people dislike this, but when I read it, I actually viewed it as the grace of God that sometimes forces us to change even though we know it's going to be painful and we don't want to do it, all the while knowing it's going to be good for us. Sometimes God does for us what we cannot do for ourselves. I think of stories like Jonah. I'm glad for Philoctetes that God pushed him out of his comfort zone, and glad for the times in my life and others when God has done that.<br/><br/>Conclusion: these plays are more readable, to me, than the more popular ones of Sophocles that I have read. Of all Sophocles' plays, my favorites are:<br/>Antigone<br/>Women of Trachis<br/>Electra<br/>Ajax<br/>Philoctetes<br/><br/>So, 4/5 are in this volume. I will say, there are some parts of the Greek tragedy that make it not necessarily my favorite genre. But there is a lot of poetic and life depth to it. I want to continue to re-read these five plays in the years to come and continue to mine their depths.",,,1,1

This is the era in the 1950s when Mao Zedong reigned supreme, and anything that anyone said could get interpreted as being against the Communist party. Her father’s crimes include teaching the Big Bang…and Einstein’s theory of relativity…which are construed by convoluted logic to be Western propaganda meant to undermine the Party.<br/><br/>I’ve always found it hard as a Westerner to fathom such bizarre politicizing and inhuman behavior. Scenes like that feel alien because we’ve never experienced anything like it here in the West.<br/><br/>But actually…it’s not so far-fetched. I can see the extreme polarization that we are reaching in our politics today where anything and everything is politicized and weaponized. I’m afraid we are going a bad direction. But I digress.<br/><br/>At first glance, this first scene appears disconnected from the rest of the plot. But it’s not. I’ll come back to it.<br/><br/>Ye Wenjie is exiled for her father’s “sins.” She goes to work at a secret base known as Red Coast, which sends out an enormous radio signal, the world’s strongest, actually. What she’s told that the base does and what it actually does are two very different things. But eventually Ye discovers the truth that only a small handful of people there know.<br/><br/>Spoilers from here on out by the way. There’s just no way to talk about this book AT ALL without spoilers. It’s not possible. Otherwise this review would be generic vague garbage.<br/><br/>So anyways, Ye discovers that the actual purpose of Red Coast Base is to send out the world’s largest radio wave signal in order to make contact with extraterrestrials. The People’s Republic of China is bothered by the fact that the USA and USSR have both sent out signals into space to make contacts with alien lifeforms, and they are worried about the consequences if aliens only heard from these other nations.<br/><br/>So they need to send out their own message and represent their own worldview. And of course they want to do it bigger and better and send it out to more star systems than the other nations. Hence the insanely huge radio station, which, when operating, makes people’s hairs stand up on end, literally, and other weird things. It affects the local weather. It’s weird.<br/><br/>Anyways, Ye Wenjie is a bit of an astrophycisist nerd, and she—despite her outsider status—gets promoted and given the authority (eventually) to operate the telescope and plan out their experiments because she just flat-out has the expertise that no one else there has.<br/><br/>One day she makes a very interesting discovery, and the way she makes it is really cool so I won’t spoil all of that, but basically, she discovers a way to amplify their radio signal by millions of times. Quite literally. And there’s real science behind this. This book taught me about some very interesting scientific principles, I’ll just leave it at that.<br/><br/>And in fact, all of these details up to this point are actual history. Red Coast Base existed and did all of this.<br/><br/>But the book diverges from history and becomes alternate history at a certain point. In this story, the ETs phone back, and in short, the message is: Don’t send any other messages out! If you do, there are aliens who will be able to deduce your location* and then they will use that to come to your planet and destroy you!<br/><br/>Basically, there is an interesting property of how radio communication in space works. You can only really tell the vague direction of the transmission that you received. It could have come from any distance in that general direction, so you don’t know which of thousands of stars it came from. However, if you send out a message in response, and then they send you another message in response to that…now all of the sudden you have some data to work with. You know roughly how long it takes for messages to go between the two of you. Based on that you can narrow it down pretty precisely to which star the messenger is sending messages from.<br/><br/>So, Ye gets this message. What does she do? She actually responds. She says: Humanity is screwed up. We deserve to be obliterated.<br/><br/>Now let that sink in. She is a character so jaded and also so intelligent that she came up with that response. She has seen some awful, awful stuff.<br/><br/>So anyways, that’s the first section of the book. The rest of the book takes place many years later, in modern day. I won’t give away any more spoilers because some pretty cool revelations happen, but some of the things that you can expect are conspiracy theories that turn out to be true (more or less), some interesting astrophysics, super advanced aliens, string theory (higher ordered dimensions), the three body problem of course.<br/><br/>Also, a really interesting exploration of how Earth’s nations and cultures would be effected at a global scale if it were proven that there were aliens coming to destroy us, aliens who are demonstrably several times more advanced than us. Such an existential threat has profound impacts and there are all sorts of groups that arise from this.<br/><br/>This story is essentially the story of humanity’s struggle to survive, and the first battle to be fought is psychological. How can you give up and not lose hope when your enemy has tanks and you have clubs (by analogy)? So part of the story is about political warfare, propaganda, etc. <br/><br/>And because the aliens aren’t arriving for another 500 years, the preparations have to take place over many generations of humanity. How does one coordinate such a vast undertaking? One of the implications is that, because the vast majority of Earth’s GDP is going to be put towards building a space fleet for the defense of Earth, this means that standards of living will decline greatly and people will lose heart.<br/><br/>So they expect morale to reach a nadir in the future. To counteract that, once they have their plans set into motion, they take some of their officers with the highest amount of faith and fortitude and put them into hibernation, essentially sending them as reinforcements for the future. This creates a really satisfying throughline for us to follow as familiar characters wake up hundreds of years later and see how things have changed. But I digress. That’s the plot of the second book in the series, not this one.<br/><br/>This book is about uncovering some covert sabotaging that the aliens are doing on humanity from far away. How can they even do this? It appears for a while to be absolute magic, in fact even I was fooled. But by the end of the book, the mysteries are revealed and it is quite satisfying, if a little far-fetched, and yet not outside the realm of possibility. I’ll just leave it at that. There are some very wild concepts in here of what super advanced civilizations could do if they could access more than three physical dimensions.<br/><br/>In short, this book is awesome. I love so many things about it. It’s so intelligent. The guy who wrote this, Liu Cixin, must have so much knowledge of so many disparate fields in order to pull all these things together and come up with this. It’s truly remarkable. This is hard science at its best, pulled into a space opera type plot of epic proportions.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and that opening scene? Turns out it’s vital. The main characters are survivors of some atrocities that make them really tough, that give them certain traits that turn out to be invaluable when they are sent as reinforcements to the future in the next book, which is also awesome. But I digress.",,,1,0

It sounds like the most mundane book, and I kind of assumed that it would only have obvious things in it that I already knew.<br/><br/>So I’m really glad my boss at my last job recommended it to me. I had been sharing with him about how I struggle with constant decision anxiety over what to do next, long lists of things… I’m really ADHD and I make lists on lists on lists and always have way more things to do than I can possibly ever do. Maybe I can do a tenth of it in my lifetime. Maybe.<br/><br/>I also have piles of things all over my house—well, not any more! I HAD piles of things all over my house, because this book convinced me to put everything into one “inbox” and then process it all. And I’m glad I did. I haven’t processed the whole inbox yet, but just putting everything in one place has already helped me quite a bit.<br/><br/>I didn’t realize how much anxiety it was giving me to have all of these random items, piles of items, baskets of items, whatever, lying in all these different areas all over my house. I feel so much more serene already. But I won’t be fully satisfied until I’ve actually processed the pile. Which I’m planning to do Monday, and honestly, I can’t wait to get that freedom of knowing that EVERYTHING in my life that needs to be done is captured in one system.<br/><br/>This book has principles that are really simple, kind of basic and obvious in hindsight. Some of them I had already figured out, some I hadn’t, but the real beauty of this book is that when you put all of these building blocks together, you get a system that is airtight, that lets your mind rest and stop having anxiety about everything you need to do and aren’t doing. No more vague worrying about whether you have some deadlines coming up, or whether there’s something you should have already done and what the consequences might be. No more worrying about forgetting things. No more of any of that. <br/><br/>Because when you implement this system fully, then you know that all of the things you need to do are all written down and are all tracked in your system and that when there are time-dependent tasks, you will get a reminder from yourself that will show up at the appropriate time.<br/><br/>You also have certain habits you do to review different lists regularly so you’re always up-to-date on making sure that you are, at any current moment, doing the right thing. And that is so awesome because then you can just get in the flow of DOING, one simple thing at a time, without all the background anxieties related to productivity. You can just get in a zen, unworried state.<br/><br/>Honestly, I’m excited. I can just feel my blood pressure going down as I implement each part of this system and get closer and closer to that airtightness.<br/><br/>That said, yes, many little details in this book are clearly outdated. He wrote this in a time when the world was in a hybrid state between physical paper and digital. Obviously we now live in an age where we have way better digital calendars etc. So yes, lots of little details in here are outdated, and it would be great for this book to have an update, but putting all of that aside…<br/><br/>None of that really mattered to me too much, because he teaches you concepts in such a way that you can implement them in multiple ways. He helps you understand the principles and doesn’t get hung up with “do it with this exact tool”…even though it is really precise and detailed, at the same time. I am doing a couple of things differently than he recommends but the point is that I am now implementing a system with that airtight system. My productivity is really going up.<br/><br/>Just a note, this book will not do anything for helping you decide what is actually important, or how to make a good strategy or have good vision…those are all for other books (and if you’re interested, I’d recommend Start With Why and What’s Your Problem?).<br/><br/>The way he describes it is, I’m not going to talk to you in this book about how to make sure you’re sailing in the right direction. But I will help you run a really good, tight ship that you’ll be proud of.<br/><br/>So thankful for this.",,,1,0

Cynicism is the philosophy that man should live in accordance with nature. Correspondingly, we should be mistrustful of all man-made, artificial institutions, such as government, social norms, money, and all pursuit of wealth fame or status, which we do to impress others and have no place in nature.<br/><br/>My dad described a philosopher to me whose area of expertise was determinism. He was emphatic in his books about how there was no such thing as luck, or God. Then one day, he was telling my dad a story about how when he was gambling, he was on a good streak, and he “just knew” that he was going to keep winning, that some unseen force was on his side. My dad said, “what do you mean? You say in your philosophy that there’s no such thing as luck.” He said, “Oh, that’s philosophy. That doesn’t apply to real life.”<br/><br/>You can guess what I think about that.<br/><br/>Cynic philosophers were on the other end of the spectrum. They dispensed with any study of mathematics or metaphysics (things that other Greek schools of thought all felt the need to obligatorily have a stance on, even if it was only tangentially related at best to their projects). Cynicism focused entirely on putting into practice how to live a truly happy life, prompting others to ask whether it was truly a philosophy or more a “way of life.” What should true philosophy be if not a way of life?<br/><br/>And that’s why I like the Greek philosophers so much more than modern philosophers. Modern philosophers are so caught up with whether they CAN make an argument that they never stop to ask if they SHOULD be making an argument.<br/><br/>On the other hand, cynicism was a way of life first and foremost, making some even question whether it counted as a true philosophy, since it had no school and completely ignored certain popular philosophical questions and the natural sciences as being unnecessary.<br/><br/>Cynics saw all of the things that money is used to buy and said, I don’t need any of those things. They carefully observed how the pursuit of wealth was an infinite game that only made the person pursuing it want more and more, and in the end, leads only to misery. Likewise, the pursuit of status in society only feeds an insatiable beast. But observe the lily of the meadows and the birds of the fields, how they don’t worry about what to eat or what to wear, and yet they never want. Oh wait—was that Jesus?—my bad.<br/><br/>The founder of cynicism was Diogenes “The Dog,” a name meant to be insulting but which he embraced with relish. Diogenes’ catchprase was “deface the currency.” He wandered about Athens openly criticizing anyone and everyone in public. He was homeless, only owned the clothes on his back and a walking stick and a bowl—that is, until he saw a beggar boy drinking water out of his cupped hands. With that, he exclaimed, “A child has beaten me in plainness of living,” and threw away the bowl.<br/><br/>Diogenes ate, slept, and lived in public, most notably sleeping in a large urn and, yes, masturbating in public. Despite being an insulting, spurious figure, he became such a fixture of Athens that he was celebrated as part of the city in his own way; when a teenager shattered the urn that he lived in, the city of Athens punished the teenager and funded a new urn to be given in its place. I imagine this was because they prided themselves in their diversity of philosophical schools, their freedom of thought, and amusing public discourse—which, Diogenes was nothing if not amusing.<br/><br/>He once went about in broad daylight with a lantern. Whenever someone would ask him what he was doing, he would say, “Looking for a man (meaning in context, a true human being).” Cynics considered man to be basically good in his natural state, but corrupted by artifice. They actually looked to animals and saw that they are happier than others. Diogenes liked being compared to a dog, for after all, a dog is shameless (as he believed one should be—you shouldn’t pursue even slightly the respect of others). A dog eats and shits and breeds in public and feels no shame. And dogs are one of the happiest species out there!<br/><br/>It’s interesting, I think he has a point while simultaneously disagreeing with him somewhat. I think some types of shamelessness are to be admired, but not all. My criticism of them is the same that some other philosophers levied at them, which was that there was no place for a cynic to be a productive member of society or to engage in politics, because they think of the whole thing as hogwash. This is a conflict I find myself frequently up against. I view politics as fundamentally corrupt and broken, and yet, the system we have is better than other systems (so far…I don’t assume that we can’t find a better one). And if I don’t participate, then I’m really not making the system any better. But I digress.<br/><br/>This book is a history of cynicism throughout ancient Greek history, following a handful of cynic philosophers, and terminating in Julian, a Roman emperor who was not a true philosopher in the sense of that being his main occupation, but who was influential in preserving the legacy of cynicism.<br/><br/>There are many colorful tales in this book and a good exploration of both the merits and the valid criticisms of the philosophy. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and not just because I’m a bit of a cynic myself, but because it was quite accessible, only a couple hundred pages in length, and probably the most engaging ancient Greek book so far in terms of stories and anecdotes. I highly recommend it as a good entry text to the world of ancient Greek philosophy. I would read this, several of Plato’s works, a handful of stoic works, and if you’re feeling brave, Epictetus’s The Art of Happiness—or just skim it for the good parts.",,,1,0

Why?<br/><br/>My father was a philosopher, part of that class of people whose books are the absolute hardest to read: full of obscure words and words that have been redefined either by them or by other philosophers that they assume you have read. We once read a philosopher in an ethics class who loved to use the word “ubiquitous.” Ubiquitous. Do you know what ubiquitous means? It means “commonplace, ordinary.” Apparently the irony of using such a non-commonplace word for a word that means commonplace when straight over that philosopher’s head.<br/><br/>And it is just completely unnecessary to use an obscure word if it doesn’t give you any extra sense of meaning over the common one! I have no patience for pretense.<br/><br/>As such, I have always had a love-hate relationship with philosophy. After all, what questions could be more important to contemplate than: Is there such a thing as free will? Is there God, and if so, what can we know about such a being? How do we know what is true; how do we come to knowledge accurately?<br/><br/>I spend great time contemplating these things and I have my thoughts on them, but it’s hard to know if you’re truly having an original thought or just reinventing the wheel if you don’t take the time to actually read all of the existing work in that field.<br/><br/>Thus far in life, I have not had the energy to really go through it all, although I have been investigating ancient Greek and Roman philosophers; I have a vague notion of one day reading all the way up through modern philosophers, but I’m just not going to commit to that level of torture—I mean, pleasure. Yeah, that’s what I meant.<br/><br/>Anyway. I stumbled upon this book when I was a teenager, and it was perfect for me. Sophie’s World is about a Norwegian teenager who starts getting letters in her mailbox with philosophical questions enclosed. First through letters, and then in person, an older man—a philosopher—teaches her all about philosophy, starting from the ancient Greeks and going chronologically through history, showing the progression of thought, how each new era builds on another, showing the cycle of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this older man is having a friendship with her in secret for quite some time? It isn’t until the final act that he meets her mother. And that’s the one reason I just can’t bring myself to give this five stars. I just…no, nothing sexual happens. But it’s just creepy. I just…how did the author think that that would sound ok and fine? But anyways. Setting that completely aside, because at the end of the day, it just sounds bad, but nothing inappropriate happens. So.<br/><br/>For me the whole premise of teaching me the history of philosophy in laymen’s terms, simplified as much as possible, with an overview that’s quick but not too quick, and couches the whole thing in a narrative, is just great. Is it perfect? No, I mean obviously when trying to cover such a technical field concisely there are bound to be things that he leaves out that some people think are important. Now that I’ve read a bunch of Plato, I noticed when I re-read Sophie’s World that there were a couple of points that I disagreed with him on. But overall, I think he did a pretty good job of summarizing Plato and Socrates. I’m not really qualified to say whether he did the same for the other philosophers, but he gives the impression of being pretty fair and even-handed and not fanboying too too much over his favorite philosophers.<br/><br/>This book has been invaluable to me so that I can get an overview of all of philosophy and feel more comfortable with the general topology of the landscape. I re-read it a year or two ago and took copious notes. I will return to them time and again as I continue my journey slowly—veeeeery slowly, because I don’t want to get burned out—on the epic journey of philosophy.",,,2,0

You don’t “rate” it. Normal considerations—style, organization, even your personal opinions of its content—fall away in the face of life change.<br/><br/>When I came into recovery in 2012, the book Alcoholics Anonymous did not impress me. I was seeking help for a different addiction, not alcoholism. I learned that Alcoholics Anonymous was the first twelve step program from which all others sprung. Ok, fine, that’s nice historical information, I thought. But I failed to see why some meetings had us read so much from “The Big Book,” as people in recovery circles colloquially call the book titled Alcoholics Anonymous. I preferred the books which addressed my addiction specifically.<br/><br/>Time passed, I got sober, I worked the steps, my depression lifted, shame guilt and anxiety too became all much much less. My relations with other people got a lot better and I became able to see, whenever I got into self-pity, resentment, or control, how whenever I am disturbed, there is somewhere inside me that I have a part to play, that even when I truly am a victim of circumstance, that healing only comes about by focusing on my part, not other people’s. I could write a lot about my experiences finally getting free of resentment towards people I thought I could never forgive, or the various epiphanies I had on the road surrounding things like powerlessness, willingness, surrender, what the heck is up with this Higher Power thing, openmindedness, control, self pity, and forgiveness. But there are already so many written accounts of the life change people have experienced, and in fact, that’s what most of this book is.<br/><br/>The point is, after a few years of progress, I began to struggle quite a bit. I finally bit the bullet and asked someone to be my sponsor who really intimidated me—not because their personality was intimidating, mind you—but just because they had so much sobriety and wisdom, they were what people call “old timers.” I was always really afraid to ask a true old-timer to sponsor me (“sponsor” means “mentor”, essentially). But when I finally did ask one of them and he said yes, I started to work through the steps again in a much deeper, more meaningful way than with the 10 sponsors I had had prior. It was so good.<br/><br/>And one of the surprising things was, he taught me the 12 steps not through the texts that are specific to my (our) addiction, but instead through the text known as Alcoholics Anonymous. I had ignored it for years, thinking it didn’t apply to me. But when we really dug into it, I discovered just how deep and rich it is.<br/><br/>The first 20% of AA (the Alcoholics Anonymous book) is “the program,” explaining what addiction is (alcoholism specifically, but you can translate in your head to your own disease of choice), and explaining the solution, how to work the steps. There is a chapter called “We Agnostics,” specifically for those who really struggle with the whole Higher Power thing. The path toward believing in God is made as broad as possible to invite in even died-in-the-wool agnostics and atheists. It really is amazing how many people I have met in recovery rooms who were before totally shut off to the concept of God, and yet discovered in these rooms a faith they thought they would never have. How did they come there?<br/><br/>In short, it’s this: you come in desperate. “No one comes into their first meeting on a winning streak.” Not a person on the planet wants to admit to being an addict. All of us come in after some kind of bottoming out experience.<br/><br/>And that bottoming out doesn’t have to be going to prison or being divorced or having a near death experience. For some of us it’s being fired, or being found out by a spouse. For others, it’s seeing the consequences on children or other family members. For some of us, the event itself was not of such enormous dramatic significance, it was more of a last straw, it was more just that we were sick and tired of being sick and tired: filled with anxiety, depression, toxic shame, deep-seated guilt.<br/><br/>Or for me, it was finally getting the clarity that, despite all I had ever said to the contrary, that the reality was that my disease was in fact progressive, and realizing with dead certainty that it was going to get a lot worse if I didn’t get outside help, and quick, too. I got to what AA calls “the jumping off point,” that place where you can’t imagine life without alcohol (or whatever your drug is), and you also can’t imagine a life with it either. If you’ve never been there, it’s impossible to describe the utter despair that sets in. But thankfully, along with that despair comes the “gift of desperation.”<br/><br/>Through most of my life, I had been able to do anything I set my mind to. At school or with jobs or with personal relationships or other goals, I could do it! Just apply my willpower and creativity and intellect, and I could figure anything out. <br/><br/>But then I ran into this one area of my life where that didn’t work: my addiction. After dozens of ways of trying to not do it or to manage and control doing it, I finally came to that place of realizing with dead certainty that nothing I could do would make any difference. I was trapped.<br/><br/>I have to laugh at myself right now; I intended to review a book and instead this is turning into a memoir. Maybe that’s ok. But for the sake of getting on to the book, suffice it to say: I considered myself hopeless before walking into a twelve step program. I had tried a psychiatrist and drugs, legal and illegal, I had tried counseling and exorcisms and all manners of trying to outsmart myself and set boundaries and have accountability…none of that made a dent. The twelve steps is what got me free.<br/><br/>To clarify, when I got into recovery I also did some other things that helped. I did a lot of more targeted therapy as well, which I believe helped in a supplemental sort of way: it gave me clarity as to why I “needed” my drug. But in-and-of-itself, all that self knowledge did not get me sober. And without establishing sobriety, I was going nowhere fast.<br/><br/>What did get me sober was a moment a couple of years into the program where I finally got desperate, sick and tired of being sick and tired, and I prayed a prayer. I had had a great deal of difficulty with believing that even if there was a God, how could I ever know if I was being guided by God? I certainly couldn’t trust the voices in my head: I was extremely delusional! So I prayed: “God, you know I have trouble hearing your voice. So here’s what I’m going to do. I am just going to do whatever the hell my sponsor tells me to do, no matter what—short of jumping off a bridge—and trust that that is your will for me.”<br/><br/>I most certainly did NOT tell my sponsor that I had prayed that prayer. But here’s what happened. My sponsor told me to go to seven meetings a week and make five phone calls a day and work the steps regularly. I gasped with horror—“I don’t have enough time to do that!”—but I had said I would go to ANY lengths. So I committed to doing it. On top of that, he would give me random one-off assignments all the time, as if the meeting and five phone calls a day weren’t enough, the son of a bitch! But I did it.<br/><br/>And something miraculous happened. I had never been able to string two or three sober days together before, but finally I did. I got sober for a week before relapsing. Some more time passed, and I got sober for a month. And then longer and longer. For me it was a progressive victory thing, but eventually I got to where I was going years at a time. And even more important, recovering in a deeper sense than mere sobriety.<br/><br/>Why does the twelve steps work? Part of the explanation is pretty simple. There’s research to back up the idea that the opposite of addiction is connection. Going to all those meetings and making all those calls forced me to finally actually be known by others instead of isolating.<br/><br/>The other part was working the steps. That’s where, for me, the more lasting life change comes in so that I don’t relapse and get myself into worse trouble than before. That’s where the book Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) comes in.<br/><br/>What are the steps?<br/>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives had become unmanageable.<br/>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.<br/>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.<br/>4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br/>5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<br/>6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<br/>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.<br/>8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.<br/>9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.<br/>10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.<br/>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.<br/>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br/><br/>The foundation of the program is steps one through three, which can be summarized as: “I can’t; God can; I think I’ll let Him.” The rest of the program can only be done meaningful if relying on God to help; because we addicts are in no position to be able to do the rest on our own.<br/><br/>But for most of us, the first three steps are insanely difficult. Admitting you’re completely powerless over your addiction is really hard, and admitting that you aren’t fit to manage your life at all is even harder. And then there’s the second step: so many people just can’t get down with the God business. And then the third step, also known as surrender? What does that even mean? I struggled with all of these.<br/><br/>People will have all kinds of arguments about these concepts and hate them for a variety of reasons, one of which being the reliance on God. All of these arguments, however, actually meant nothing in the face of death. If you are drowning in addiction, you no longer care about whether something “makes sense” to you: you get to a place where you realize that if there is a solution out there, it’s going to by definition be something that doesn’t make sense to you, because if it did make sense, you would have tried it already! And because I was drowning, I became willing to try anything, to go to any lengths.<br/><br/>So I turned to working these steps not out of logic but out of a necessity to try anything that might possibly work for me. It felt like the last house on the block—there was nothing else left but to kill myself. Yes I was in a dark place. But if you’re going to kill yourself anyways, what do you have to lose? So I threw myself into it.<br/><br/>The first part of this book (after the forewards) is a chapter titled “The Doctor’s Opinion.” I skipped this the first time, not realizing how critical that it is to getting me to understand the true nature of my disease. It’s an open letter from a leading doctor at a hospital for the treatment of alcoholism, someone who had seen thousands of cases and knew right off the bat which ones were helpless cases: it didn’t matter how many second chances they were given, they were helpless to stop themselves from drinking again. He admits frankly that everything science had thrown at cases like these had very little effect. And then he goes on to detail how now hundreds of such cases (the “hopeless variety” of alcoholic, as he calls them) have come to recover, and are changed men. The mere existence of this letter is incredible: you have a very prominent doctor putting his reputation on the line, putting it in print that he absolutely recommends a SPIRITUAL program as an actual treatment for something recognized by the medical profession as a disease (alcoholism).<br/><br/>After that we have Bill’s story, the founder of AA. He was a crazy SOB before recovery, not someone you would have wanted to know. His story is remarkable. Then we have chapters titled There Is a Solution and More About Alcoholism. These outline the problem in stark lines. <br/><br/>Then you have a chapter We Agnostics, that helps address those who are atheistic and agnostic and shares the stories of many people who began with that belief system but were then able to progress slowly into having faith. Everyone is free to define their Higher Power in whatever matter works for them. For many agnostics, the first evidence they have of God is the fact that they are hearing the stories of all the other alcoholics in meetings who have gotten sober, and watching some of those transformations happen before their very eyes. And so their first basic conception of a Higher Power is the group, or whatever power it is that is miraculously causing the alcoholics in their group to get sober.<br/><br/>That was my experience as well. As I got to know people in my program who had been really hopeless, who had done awful, terrible things, and yet here they were telling me they were sober—and the thing is, you can sniff out bullshit to a certain level, and these people did not smell like bullshit. And there is no way that the person who they are describing in the past is the same person that they are now, that I’m witnessing them being. Not everyone in recovery is a saint, but I zoned in on a handful of people whose lives had undoubtedly changed. Since then, I’ve gotten to witness firsthand some pretty incredible stories, too, been at someone’s first meeting and then seen them go from depressed, sure of impending divorce, a self-centered self-pitying wreck unable to go a few days sober, to becoming such a transformed person, a person that people go to for spiritual life advice—you can’t make this stuff up.<br/><br/>So anyways, that made me pay attention. That did something for my faith that no amount of logic or theology or philosophy could have ever touched a hair of.<br/><br/>Next are the chapters titled How It Works, Into Action, and Working With Others, which outline the whole program, all twelve steps, in just 45 pages. How It Works alone covers most of what the program is. It’s a really hard program, but it’s also a very simple program and in fact the only reason it’s 45 pages and not much less than that is that there are plenty of examples and time spent on objections. These chapters are where the meat is, the life change. I have underlined and annotated the mess out of this section and come back to it again and again; you start to know the page numbers by heart, and I find myself telling others “go read pages 60-62, that deals with exactly where you are, and let me tell you my experience with applying those pages to my life…” Yes, I have become one of THOSE people. But hopefully not in a bad way.<br/><br/>After that there are chapters To Wives, The Family Afterward, To Employers. Honestly these feel dated but they still have nuggets.<br/><br/>Then there’s A Vision for You, supremely helpful for vision-casting. This takes us up through page 164.<br/><br/>The remaining 400 pages of the book are the personal stories. One after another, alcoholics from every kind of walk of life share their stories. The first third of them are founders, the next third are people in the second wave, and the final third are people who came into AA after it was well established. The stories seem to have been picked for diversity of experiences: being a minority, being a woman, various careers and experiences like homelessness, co-addictions, codependence, divorce, prison, death of loved ones. All of them follow a general format of first sharing their story, letting you see just how bad it gets, then showing what changed, and then finally, sharing what wisdom or advice has helped them the most.<br/><br/>I love that some of these stories have so much meat on them. I have underlined and annotated many of these stories, some of them just as heavily as How It Works.<br/><br/>The style of writing is rather bare bones. It doesn’t always SEEM to be profound, and it’s written in a slightly different vernacular. Sometimes things seem common sense, or I didn’t understand why they were making a big deal about different points…but now I do, because when I’ve gotten stuck in recovery I’ve discovered that the old timers that I turn to for advice invariably point me back to the big book for the answers. In short, even with all the quibbles, it’s impossible to rate this book as anything other than five stars because it has helped me profoundly to change at the deepest levels of how I operate, of how I do life. And because all the other recovery books that I get a lot out of are derived from this book.<br/><br/>No one will ever convince me that the twelve steps “don’t work.” I’ve seen hundreds of people come into the recovery rooms. The vast majority flake out: either they never come back at all or they work a half-hearted program for a couple months and then quit. Some people come to meetings regularly but never actually work the steps. Of all the people I’ve seen come into these rooms, I have yet to see someone really roll up their sleeves and work the program and NOT see life-changing results. <br/><br/>This stuff works: it works too well for people to believe. I’ve heard some people criticize and say “it doesn’t work,” but as soon as you ask them some basic questions it invariably becomes obvious they have never worked it at all. And I was one of those for a while; I didn’t think I needed to work something like that because I was smart and it insulted my intelligence. I was too smart for my own good.<br/><br/>When I struggle it’s usually for that reason. It doesn’t make sense to me that the twelve steps have anything to do with establishing sobriety, much less any of the other advice that’s been given to me by sponsors throughout the years. But I realize that whatever the solution is, it has to be something that doesn’t make sense to me, otherwise I wouldn’t have the problem that I do. <br/><br/>I’m just grateful that this program exists because without it I’d still be deep in my delusion, or worse yet I’d probably be dead—for when I’m in my disease I get suicidal. <br/><br/>Thank God I’m not there today. This program gave me hope, gave me examples of people just as bad off as me who actually recovered, and gave me freedom from toxic guilt and shame. Those issues are molehills today compared to the mountains they used to be.<br/><br/>So yeah, I’m a believer. And I can’t apologize for it. Some things are worth believing in.",,,1,1

In. Space!<br/><br/>I love it when science fiction authors bring their expertise to bear to reveal fascinating depths. Adrian Tchaikovsky, quickly becoming one of my favorite science fiction authors, is a zoologist (the section of biology dedicated to animals), and his expertise really shines through. In the book prior in this series, he explores what it would look like to have sentient arthropods (spiders), and it was fascinating, if a little more squeamishness-inducing. Children of Time, the second book in this series, could easily be read as a standalone book, for those who feel the need to skip over reading about spiders in depth. But anyways.<br/><br/>I love the premise of this book. What if there was a sentient alien species that were cephalopods (octopus-like)? It’s obvious he has done a ton of worldbuilding work here, but he also has structured the book so you don’t get infodumped on too much at once. Instead you get to discover cephalopod society throughout the plot unraveling. The conflicts are driven largely by misunderstandings between four different types of species: one hominid, one arthropod, one cephalopod, and one…one which is crazy, and I’ll get to later.<br/><br/>So basically, humans are terraforming a planet that is 90% water. With so little land available for humans to live on, it makes sense that the terraforming process is mostly going to focus on building up life in the (currently lifeless) ocean. They start with micro-organisms and work their way up. One man, a marine biologist named Senkovi, ends up being separated from the rest of his crew and, long story short, is able to take on the terraforming process of this planet at his own discretion. Because of this he is able to introduce his pet project to the planet: uplifted octopi.<br/><br/>Uplifting is a concept explored elsewhere in science fiction literature, whereby an existing species is made more intelligent through scientific processes, and we can explore the concept of what a sentient species would look like if it had the evolutionary background of some type of animal other than hominids. This is exactly what Senkovi does for his octopi. The thing is, he develops them in space, and (spoilers ahead)…<br/><br/>His experiment works too well. With a little help, his cephalopods become so intelligent that they are breaking outside of the environments he designed for them and taking over the space station he lives on.<br/><br/>Side note, octopi are known to figure out all kinds of things on their own. In the ocean, they pry open clam shells to eat the meat. The intelligence that allows them to do that has been sufficient for them to figure out how to unscrew jar lids, disassemble all kinds of devices, escape from aquariums over and over…it’s really not recommended to have an octopus as a pet, much as people think it sounds like a good idea, for this reason. Also for the reason that, because they are so intelligent, they experience what only a few species on the planet are intelligent enough to experience: boredom. Octopi get quickly bored if confined in a glass box with very little to keep them entertained. They appear to get depressed over time. Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly what octopi really feel, but the symptoms are relatable.<br/><br/>So anyway, these uplifted octopi escape from the lab in space, and quickly adapt and evolve to space. Turns out, they are actually much more well-adapted to space than humans are, since they are used to operating in a three dimensional environment. They populate the water world and mine it for resources, but they also expand outwards to the stars, designing their own kind of spacecraft, which, naturally, are filled with water instead of air.<br/><br/>Tchaikovsky explores the implications of having spacecraft that are designed to be filled with water instead of air. The craft take a lot longer to accelerate because of their weight, but this the water also provides cushioning that helps them survive higher rates of acceleration. Their craft are designed to be spherical in shape. Also, their battles in space are interesting because when a projectile punctures the shell, the water squirts out into space, instantly freezing into ice.<br/><br/>But this isn’t the only thing Tchaikovsky explores. He explores how their language would be different, how their modes of communication would be different, how their different thought patterns would effect the building up of civilization at a large scale, how their politics would be different, their warfare, how their natural curiosity affects EVERYTHING…<br/><br/>There’s too much in this book for me to succinctly summarize, but one of the most interesting things that factors in is their nervous system. Basically, cephalopods have two “brains”—if by brains you mean centers of neurons that (it is believed) do computations. One is in their cranium, just like for humans. but the other is actually in their tentacles, an organ of neurons dispersed throughout them in high concentrations that Tchaikovsky calls, in this book, their “reach.” (Some biologists go so far as to say that it’s like octopi have nine brains—one in their skull, and one in each tentacle.)<br/><br/>In addition, in this book when two octopi struggle with each other, something happens in that swirling of tentacles grasping each other. Information is passed along. I wasn’t able to find scholarly literature that proves this phenomena happens currently, but hey, who knows? It would explain some of their interesting behavior, such as when octopi fight with each other and then suddenly break apart, one of them changing its mind and now supporting the other as the new alpha.<br/><br/>Tchaikovsky is theorizing in the worldbuilding of this book about what cephalopod consciousness is like. He theorizes that, essentially, it would be like having a massive subconscious capable of doing complex calculations, which all happens without you thinking about it or knowing how it works—it just does. The implications of this are profound, and lets their technological development advance at a prodigious rate in some areas—but, with a key difference from how scientific advancement happened in human’s history. For cephalopods, it progresses without their scientists consciously understanding HOW they are doing some of the things that they do. And there’s a lot of implications to that too.<br/><br/>Anyway, I know I’m nerding out pretty hard on this, but the point is, if you’ve ever wondered how cephalopod civilization could differ from ours, this book is amazing.<br/><br/>And I haven’t even touched on another major component of this book, and that explores another alien planet with a life form that did NOT originate even remotely from Earth. Right from the get-go, the explorers discovering this planet are intrigued. It has all of these floating creatures in the air, which are able to, in this thick atmosphere, propel themselves like jellyfish do in water. There are other creatures which appears to drift with the winds, kind of like blimps. And on the ground, there are all kinds of other living things.<br/><br/>The planet has an entire ecosystem built up on fundamentally different building blocks at the cellular level. I don’t understand all the technical details, but essentially, these species don’t have DNA, but they do have something akin to RNA. And, among other things, one of the other differences on this planet’s ecosystem is that they don’t have hard and fast plant-animal distinctions. They have a lot of creatures that float about similarly to blimps, and they may have a migration phase, followed by a rooted phase where they dig into the soil in one location and gather nutrients and reproduce.<br/><br/>But the craziest life form on this planet is not at all visible. Not at first. I told you there would be spoilers right? Major ones coming…<br/><br/>The most fascinating species in this book (even rivaling the cephalopods) can be best thought of as a viral hive mind. This idea of his is phenomenally cool. And terrifying. But essentially, what if an alien species could infect all kinds of different species virally, and also had a distributed consciousness? When it infects a new host, of course, this part of itself is not able to directly communicate with the rest of the species. But the different colonies find ways of communicating with each other because the way they infect their hosts is subtle, as if it slips in between all the cells that exist already…it retains the intelligence, memories, everything of the infected host. And then it comes into psychic union with its host: meaning, the two minds merge.<br/><br/>The implications of this are far-reaching as well, but I’ve already spoiled enough of this book for you. Seriously, go and read this book immediately if these concepts interest you at all. The chapters written from the perspective of the viral hive mind are fascinating. And weird. But gradually, its ways of thinking become more and more comprehensible.<br/><br/>And the cool thing is, unlike so many other sci fi books that have explored parasitic aliens, in this one he actually moves beyond mere horror—although there’s a bit of that as well—but he eventually moves into another phase in the book of de-monstrifying the other, meaning: what if a species like this wasn’t just some awful predatory species? What if it was the hero of its own story? What if it didn’t view what it was doing as bad, because, after all, after it infects hosts, those hosts are always glad that they were infected in hindsight? Never mind that their thinking is changed by being infected, lol…but in its view, it helps its hosts achieve enlightenment, a greater consciousness of the universe which extends through all the physical realms all the way from the cellular level up to scale that humans are aware of.<br/><br/>I loved this book, and iImmediately ordered the next.<br/><br/>*Technically the correct plural of octopus is octopuses, but Adrian chooses to use octopi because he argues it sounds way more awesome, and I agree. All language is made up anyway.",,,1,0

She just finished her junior year of high school and is on holiday at a beach city with her mom. But her blissful experience is marred when she realizes that an older man in sunglasses is stalking her, day after day. She thinks, naturally, that he must be a stalker. But she is unable to prove his wrongdoing. Finally after much frustration with the problem, she asks him what he wants. He tells her that she needs to get up at 4am and swim out to touch this buoy and swim back every morning. She does so, and when she completes the ritual, she coughs up a mysterious gold coin with a symbol on it that seems, inexplicably, to exist in three dimensions. <br/><br/>And so the story begins which changes her life, pulling her into a magical world which will irrevocably end up changing her, both mentally and physically, by the end of the story.<br/><br/>This gripped me because it was so original and distinct. You have these students in Ukraine being forced to go to this mysterious university on threat of death to their loved ones. They are inducted into bizarre lessons, being forced to read books full of gibberish and memorize passages of the stuff which seems to shift in front of their eyes. <br/><br/>And then as Sasha grows in comprehension you have increasingly frequent passages where she talks about the experience but it is largely incomprehensible. You do slowly start to understand more and more about these weird dimensions they gain access to, but you still fall way short of being able to truly understand all they are talking about, but that is a large part of the point: how do you describe five dimensional concepts to three dimensional beings?<br/><br/>Sasha is an exceptional student of this magic. She continually exceeds the bounds that her teachers try to impose on her, sometimes accidentally. But ultimately she becomes more overtly rebellious by the end of the story; this is about an anomalous person breaking a system of control, or at least majorly challenging it.<br/><br/>But the journey is harrowing. There’s shocking bodily transformations as this continues into even stranger territory, and yet it stays grounded in many realistic details as well. Magical realism or urban fantasy? Neither. It’s its own thing, a true original.<br/><br/>There are very dark undertones to everything. Her teachers claim they are trying to “help” the students. If you perform well enough then none of your loved ones need die. It’s disturbing. <br/><br/>The Eastern European setting fits that theme pretty well. But I’m also happy to report that there is a happy (with caveats) ending to the book, with an uplifting message at the end. That makes a great deal of difference to me and increases the odds that I’ll re read it in the future.<br/><br/>The book pulls you along with a series of mysteries and does a great job of answering a lot of your questions. The university life plays large but everything feels just a little different, which could either be due to the setting being Ukraine or could be due to the strange magical nature of what the university is doing to their minds. <br/><br/>Ultimately the “why” matters less to me than just the fact that it has a distinct feeling that adds to its originality.<br/><br/>The type of magic (or science; it’s ambiguous in this case) is also very intriguing and original. It’s really hard to explain if you haven’t read it but, suffice it to say that reading this book is quite the unique experience. You can only understand by reading it. Writing a review for this is hard!<br/><br/>There’s a diverse cast of characters, rather unique personalities. Sasha’s relationships with others factors largely.<br/><br/>The book often has the feeling of a story about a young person being sucked into a cult of sorts. Only the cult is a weird magical school. Sasha’s advisor and teachers break her (and everyone else) down, demanding the impossible, constantly pushing them to breaking and then continuing to push. The body count wasn’t as high (by the time I got to the end) as I thought it was going to be, but it is a quite dark time. <br/><br/>When Sasha finally starts to pull through and get a handle on things it’s very satisfying in some ways to see her succeed, but it’s also a mixed feelings thing because she is losing her humanity…not necessarily in ways that are completely bad…but it’s scary. And it is what the situation demands of her to survive and protect her family. <br/><br/>She’s an admirable heroine. And yet she does become a little bit of a worse human being before she gets better at the end when she ultimately rejects some of the moral beliefs of the institution and makes a change to the world in a big way…trying to be vague on purpose but there’s a very meaningful moment at the end of the book.<br/><br/>All in all a rather rewarding read, and no less interesting for finding out that the authors are a married couple who grew up in Ukraine and Russia and then moved to the US.<br/><br/>I would really like to see a sequel. During this book, they allude to there being this institute that they are preparing the students for. What is that institute like? How do people use this magic in the outside world? And how does Sasha’s big change to the world play out?<br/><br/>More please.",,,1,0

I was hooked. There are many others that have had similar profound impact on me, and with so few words.<br/><br/>As I read these I got the idea that this was the perfect book to read intermittently, just one or so per day. That gave me the idea to do an experiment and post short poems as reading status updates here on GR and see what happened. There wasn’t any spectacular response, but I like the thought that maybe, just maybe, somebody was able to pause their frenetic day and have a peaceful moment of engaging in the divine because of one of those updates.<br/><br/>This particular book is one of a series of similar books which you can find at Barnes and Noble, each one small, hardback, beautifully decorated inside and out with a particular art style that I would describe as a minimalistic version of stained glass windows or mosaics. The series includes Love Poems of Rumi, Friendship Poems of Rumi, and this one: Spiritual Poems of Rumi.<br/><br/>I went into this book knowing virtually nothing about Rumi or his poetry. Rumi was an Islamic mystic who was part of a particular group known as the whirling dervishes: men who, in a trance, would spin for long periods of time as a sort of mindfulness or meditation. Rumi was known for delivering his poetry to his disciples while whirling, and as you read a poem you can picture how each short line is just long enough for him to utter between breaths while facing the students before quickly rotating away.<br/><br/>don’t look at yourself <br/>how ugly or beautiful you are <br/>look at your love (inside) instead<br/>look at the one you love <br/><br/>Most of his poems are like the ones above: profound and tightly packed, no punctuation, no capitalization, always has a twist, often has a question, although it’s not always explicit. For me this kind of poetry is great. If a poem is ambiguously written for me to read my own meaning into it, then I like it to be really short, something I can go over and over and really think about the whole thing as one body. These are perfect.<br/><br/>like an ant<br/>in a wheat harvest<br/>we are happy<br/>when carrying a burden<br/>greater than ourselves<br/><br/>He has a way of saying something that seems on face value to be ridiculous, but if you take the time to think about it and ask yourself “in what sense could it be that this is true?” you find great meaning in it. I may or may not arrive at the same exact interpretation that Rumi had in mind, but this kind of reflection is incredibly valuable because it causes me to contemplate the true nature of the spiritual world, the essence of life, and the search for meaning. The fact that these poems caused me to do that multiple times means this is a great work of art. I consider these great jumping off points for meditation.<br/><br/>Did I have the same experience with all of these poems? No. Some of them fell flat for me. Most notably, poems about “love” but which I read as being more about infatuation, losing yourself in another. He seems to deify his lover. This I can’t get into.<br/><br/>I was also confused by poems about drunkenness. I found out from my friend Werner that referring to drunkenness is a motif in Muslim literature that is not meant to be taken literally; it refers to the intoxication of spiritual experiences. I'll have to re-read those poems to see if they resonate more now that I know that.<br/><br/>Despite the poems that were misses for me, it was easy enough to just go on to the next poem until I found one that did resonate. And so I would just skim until I found the next deep poem and then camp out and have my next revelatory experience.<br/><br/>If there was ever a book that put me in the mindset of “it’s not about the destination but the journey,” then it’s this one. Less concerned with “getting it right,” whatever that’s supposed to mean, and instead with getting to the business of really living as a true human being.<br/><br/>I will leave you with two more poems:<br/><br/>if you abandon for a little while <br/>your ego and greed <br/>tear down your shield <br/>rise with a quest<br/>to unite with the divine <br/>what do you think will happen<br/><br/>get up and do some good <br/>for someone now <br/>the universe will surely <br/>safekeep your act <br/>everyone has left his <br/>belongings and is gone <br/>you too <br/>except<br/>for what good <br/>you have done",,,1,0

There tends to be two types of such books: those with a Christian bent, also called purity culture books, and those with a therapeutic bent, more based on research and therapy concepts.<br/><br/>In my experience, books in the former camp tend to be misleading and have advice that is a mixture of helpful and patently unhelpful. <br/><br/>Books in the second camp tend to have deep insight but be dense and difficult to read and digest and not necessarily easy to convert to practical takeaways. They tend to be clearly not written from a religious perspective which can be helpful but they also can get really weird in places.<br/><br/>This book, I am happy to say, is an interesting combination of those two camps. It’s based on an original research study done on over 3,000 people with unwanted sexual behaviors. <br/><br/>It was conducted by a Christian pastor in Portland who specializes in this kind of work, but he is openly critical of typical purity culture advice for dealing with unwanted sexual behaviors, which he (correctly, in my opinion) asserts does little to address underlying root problems. <br/><br/>This books whole aim is to help you look at the nature of your unwanted sexual behaviors and be able to trace them to your past trauma and your current needs, have compassion for yourself, and then actually do something to search out healing for your underlying problems. This I found to be refreshing.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of research data in here showing correlations between different unwanted sexual behaviors and correlated specific types of trauma/neglect when the person was a child. This was useful to me to help make sense of some specific sexual behaviors.<br/><br/>There’s a section on getting needs met. He builds on attachment theory. Inevitably, he says, people with unwanted sexual behaviors are doing so because they have needs they suppress and don’t get met because of various unhealthy beliefs about themselves. After the need not getting met for some time, it comes out sideways through compulsive sexual behavior.<br/><br/>It also has some interesting challenges calling us to grater sensuality, not less, by learning to appreciate life through all the senses instead of letting it pass us by.<br/><br/>Overall the messages in this book I found to be much more healing, insightful, and helpful than other books on this topic. I feel pretty comfortable endorsing it. I’m super glad he wrote it and I wish more organizations would to the kind of research that he did to help people draw connections between traumas and sexual behaviors—sex is a slippery beast and the causal links are often not intuitive, but the data doesn’t lie. <br/><br/>And, this book is also quite in line with what I have come to believe is more what I need in my life: less shaming myself (which is actually part of the problem, as he shows with data that growing up in a strict household is the number 1 thing that leads to developing unwanted sexual behaviors) and more compassion and understanding of myself. This has helped me out tremendously.",,,1,0

It feels like it could be part of a much larger series of books (although I have no idea if that’s in Susanne Clark’s plans, and would guess no). It’s kind of a perfect story, where you have lots of things happening and revealed within a short period of time. It’s somehow contemplative and fast paced at the same time. I’d like to figure out how she pulled that off for my own benefit as a writer!<br/><br/>The narrator is in a world completely foreign to our own, where everything is halls, endless halls stretching out forever. The lower halls are filled with the sea and the upper halls have clouds and the protagonist lives mostly on the in between halls. The halls are filled with statues and classical architecture. The only other living human is called The Other. There are 13 skeletons which brings the total all time population (as far as the narrator knows) to 15. He postulated the question of: what if another person one day shows up? He named this person 16 as they would be the sixteenth person the world has ever had. The concept of 16 becomes important as the story develops.<br/><br/>The narrator doesn’t remember anything of his life before five years ago. He doesn’t know that any other world exists outside of his world. I won’t say more on that because it would just ruin the experience of reading this for the first time.<br/><br/>This is a mystery novel. But not the kind that you’ve ever read before, not a murder mystery but a mystery of what is this whole world we are in and what’s the nature of our relationship to it? And who are all those skeletons? And who is The Other? You piece it together one piece at a time and it’s very satisfying. The narrator takes a while to figure out some things because he’s guileless and innocent and sincere. He’s a refreshing voice to hear after all the cynical and selfish voices of so many other books.<br/><br/>People have read into this story in a lot of different ways, seeing it as an allegory for many different things. I think it is that, while simultaneously being also it’s own story. And it’s just a really good story, the favorite thing I’ve read all year (and I’ve read about 50 books). It’s hard to talk about this without it just being all spoilers. I’ll just say…I think everyone should read it. The author worked on this for 16 years, kind of incredible story, it shows. This feels perfect in so many ways including pace and voice and originality and the surreal style and tone and just how GOOD the worldbuilding and ideas are. She’s influenced by some of CS Lewis’ ideas but it’s subtle; I missed most of that even though I know a lot about Lewis. This is not a Christina book though.<br/><br/>Some themes…isolation, worldview, perspective, the way the modern era relates to the ancient era, the world of magic and mystery that we no longer have, loss of innocence…I will say it’s not a depressing story though, it has a surprisingly satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Anyways. Just read it.<br/><br/>",,,2,0

But the focus of the story is not on these. It’s on Hadiz, a brilliant woman at a top research facility in Lagos, Nigeria. She discovers how to travel between different universes, at first as a way to try to save her version of Earth, but when it comes to be too late for that, instead she has to pivot and figure out how to make an escape from her home to one of the other versions of earth. <br/><br/>In the process, she ends up having to set free an AI from its normal constraints in order to gain its help. This creates serious implications down the line that she doesn’t have time to contemplate, but you get the feeling will drastically impact the plot later (and it does).<br/><br/>But in the meantime, Hadiz makes all sorts of amazing discoveries about the other versions of Earth, which are amazingly diverse. She discovers that for every different way that things could have gone, for every random thing determined by quantum physics, the universe splits. There are almost infinite universes out there.<br/><br/>When she travels, she stays in the same location on earth as where she left. It’s a different earth, a different version of Lagos—or the land there at least; most of the universes don’t have life. But some do. Unknown to her, there is a whole coalition of hundreds of thousands of worlds, known as the Pandominium, and they regulate and control the travel between worlds which she is unknowingly encroaching on. All of this you learn within probably the first 1/5 of the book.<br/><br/>The exploration of other Earths is fascinating. The Nigerian culture is a refreshing experience, and then there’s the romp through all the versions of Earth that exist in a multiverse where there are branches at every possible random choice in the chain of causality that stretches all the way back to the Big Bang. It’s breathtaking.<br/><br/>When looking at a very similar Earth it’s interesting to see all the little variations and trace lines, connecting the dots gradually of how one thing could have affected another, resulting in larger diversions from our own reality. <br/><br/>And then sometimes we look at ones that diverged massively and those are also very interesting, especially looking at the way that sentient life could have developed from a different non-ape-like species.<br/><br/>And then there is other life out there that is very fascinating…being vague to avoid spoilers but I will just say that it’s super interesting.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, there is a great pan-dimensional conflict unfolding. There’s all kinds of prejudices of organics against machines and vice versa, carnivorous people groups against herbivores, and so forth. There’s politics and intrigue and conspiracies. Carey launches us onto an ambitious, grand ocean of worldbuilding, and demands that we swim.  Fortunately, he also guides us into the deep water gradually, step by step. I consider this a great case study for myself in how to gradually introduce the reader to a vast world that the author has built.<br/><br/>And then, our main characters have their own conflicts that are much smaller in scale but as the plot progresses, ends up being entangled in these much grander conflicts in interesting ways. <br/><br/>There’s also a whole section of the book with its own planet that we focus on with people very different from Homo sapiens and an awesome character…unfortunately it’s hard to talk about any of that without feeling like I would be ruining part of the experience of reading that firsthand.<br/><br/>This book also has very relatable antagonists to the point that I find myself rooting for them and then remembering that hold on, if they succeed, that’s going to be very bad for the protagonists who I care about even more! That’s really good.<br/><br/>There are so many things this book does well. There’s very memorable and likable characters, there are truly tough villains, nobody is an idiot, the setting and plot and characters are all interwoven, so many things. <br/><br/>This book also has the distinction of having the most interesting military subcultures that I’ve read, maybe ever.<br/><br/>There’s also a great sense of wonder. The book starts off feeling a little bit more like hard science fiction with just enough explanation of physics and such things that it helps you buy into the premise but then the book becomes so much more.<br/><br/>Gosh. And just the fact that all of this amazing setting and worldbuilding is revealed primarily through action, through stuff happening in the plot. This is definitely one of my favorite works of science fiction. Ever.<br/><br/>The notion of whether machines could be considered alive is also explored quite intelligently in this book, but again done so by the plot pushing the conversation forward…I love this book. There is so much in here. Looking forward to reading the next one in the series! I need it now.",,,1,0

She has written two books. Both are undeniable masterpieces, and I do not use that word lightly: stunningly original, full of beautiful language and concepts, striking characters, striking concepts, and just extremely well-crafted, the kind of books you don’t ever want to put down until they are done. Her more recent work is a short novel, Piranesi. 16 years before, she wrote Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, a much longer work.<br/><br/>The setting is Enlightenment England (think Jane Austen), but an alternate-history version of England, wherein magic played a major part in its history. That history is rich and layered with different epochs and periods of decreasing virility up until the present day of when our story unfolds, in a day in which magic has now been dead for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Our story begins with observing a couple of gentlemen, Honeyfoot and Segundus, join a society of Yorkshire magicians, only to discover that all these supposed “magicians” do is talk about and read about magic—not one of them has every done a lick of it, not even once! When the naive Honeyfoot asks why the emperor has no clothes, he inadvertently triggers a landslide of vitriol and outrage, all masked under all sorts of pretenses that we all know are just plain rubbish concealing the fact that these men are not magicians at all.<br/><br/>This scene is executed very comedically and sets the tone for the novel. For indeed, a lot of what makes this novel so good is the portrayals of Victorian nobility and their silliness, just as if you were reading Dostoevsky or Jane Austen. It can be quite funny.<br/><br/>Only, you also have all this magic. One could simply describe this book as “magical Jane Austen” and not be far off from the truth.<br/><br/>The book primarily follows the rise of Mr. Norrell for a while, and then later Jonathan Strange, who become the two great magicians of a new age of magic. Norrell first comes on the scene, showing up all the York magicians by showing up and doing the first bit of real, documented magic that has been seen in England for a long time. (He set a bet with them that required that, upon him doing the magic, they would all have to recuse themselves as magicians).<br/><br/>Norrell sets out with the goal of re-establishing English magic and making it respectable again, but because he’s such a pedantic, bookish stickler of a little man, he struggles to gain traction. He really isn’t your typical hero at all; indeed he’s very unheroic, cowardly, and sometimes spiteful, although utterly remorseful and conciliatory the next moment, like a child. He is more to be pitied and chuckled at than anything.<br/><br/>And yet, for the first part of the book, he is a compelling main character to follow because you see him triumph over such crippling inner problems. You really root for him and rejoice with him as he makes progress. But it’s later in the book that the negative side of his character becomes more at play, and in contrast we become more drawn to Jonathan Strange, who becomes the protagonist for the rest of the book.<br/><br/>One of the most frustrating thing about Norrell is how he sets out to control magic. First, he buys up all actual books of magic and prevents anyone else in the whole country from getting their hands on them. He locks them all up in his library that he never lets anyone into. Second, he sets out constantly to discredit anyone else who claims to be a magician and make it abundantly clear that he is England’s only magician. Despite being able to accomplish this though, he is so insecure and anxious that he can never stop being paranoid of others, and these worries and doubts are preyed upon by others, most notable the two sycophants Drawlight and Lousells that attach themselves to him to “help” him manage his affairs with regards to all interactions with the rest of high society—which admittedly, he does need a great deal of help with, being (at the outset of our story) completely unknown to society, and on top of that, being very socially inept.<br/><br/>In contrast to Norrell, Strange does not start off as such an extremely bookish person. He’s a jack of all trades, master at none, wandering aimlessly in life as only the rich can afford to do. But by the end of the book he becomes such a strong character; these could really be called a coming-of-age story for Strange in a sense, only the whole book happens while he is an adult. At the onset he’s technically an adult; mentally more of a child.<br/><br/>But by the end he’s all grown up, has gone on many adventures, starting with the discovery of magic, being pupiled by Norrell, going away to fight the war in Portugal and use magic to defeat Napoleon, come home to Norrell again, and then finally gets himself out from under the thumb of Norrell, who becomes more and more controlling. After some time, Strange actually starts a whole new magical school of thought in contrast to Norrell; they each have their followings in newspapers and such; Strange publishes a book; Norrell magically makes all of its copies disappear; it’s great stuff. Strange also develops a lot of depth when he loses his wife. And as he goes deeper into magical dimensions that Norrell had forbidden him to, he finds out some amazing things and these also transform him in strange ways.<br/><br/>The plot is multi-layered. A big part of Strange’s arc has to do with losing his wife to magical bewitchment; he thinks for a long time that she has died when in reality a wicked fairy has spirited her away as revenge against Strange.<br/><br/>This wicked fairy, known only as The Man With the Thistledown Hair, factors very large in the overall plot of the whole book; he is an ancient, deeply narcissistic person (sometimes comedically so) bent on self-aggrandizement, paranoia and revenge. He factors into helping Norrell do one of his earliest most important pieces of magic (important in the sense of establishing his career in the public view) that involved saving a lady’s life…little does anyone understand though that in order to save her life, Norrell made a deal with the devil—I mean the man with the Thistledown hair—that means he now has a hold over her soul. This hold looks like an enchantment whereby every night she is transported to some far away place and dances al night till she is a walking zombie, always exhausted.<br/><br/>This enchantment factors large in the main plot, which is hard to talk about without spoiling things, but let us just say that the wicked fairy has designs for killing the king of England and putting in his place one Stephen Black.<br/><br/>Stephen Black is one of my favorite characters in this whole thing. He is a black slave, very well known for his value as a servant. He’s one of those highly intelligent and considerate souls, a really good-hearted person, but one who is nevertheless under the yoke of slavery. He bears it with the meekest compliance: what else is he to do?<br/><br/>But the irony is that the Thistledown man takes a real liking to Stephen. So you have perhaps the most spiteful character I have ever read about constantly talking about killing everyone or doing awful torturous things, all for Stephen’s “benefit” (or his own), and poor Stephen, the kind of person who would never hurt a fly, is mortified, and constantly trying to figure out how to avert crisis and talk the wicked fairy out of killing people all the time, which is no mean task. It’s really a very entertaining dynamic they have.<br/><br/>Arabella, Jonathan Strange’s wife, is an important character as well, although she is a nuanced character who it is hard to succinctly describe. And, also, there is a host of many other characters who I won’t take the time to enumerate but suffice it to say: this book is full of very strikingly painted characters of all kinds, from rogues to villains to the petty to the noble, people of absolutely every kind, and the book is just so damn funny when describing them. Susanna Clarke is just a master of characterization.<br/><br/>Books feature very heavily. And references to different magicians and their spells. And “English sensibility.” And magic, esp. teleportation through mirrors, scrying through water, and many other things. There is a whole world of magic that Susanna has invented, a Tolkien-esque feat of worldbuilding. The whole history that you get gradually exposed to feels so real and alive and nuanced and detailed. I love it.<br/><br/>A particular historical figure factors very large into the plot as well, and that is the Raven King. Long ago, England has a king who was the most powerful magician of all history. He ruled several kingdoms in Fairy as well as England, and did such a tremendous amount of things it can scarcely be believed. As time goes on, you learn gradually more of his biography, and there is a payoff toward the end of the book.<br/><br/>It’s hard to convey just how many really awesome moments there are in this book, how many moments that feel just right, how many amazing novelties that intrigue, or beautiful concepts that all alone are worth the price of admission. There is a great concept in this book that in order to really do magic, one must have a touch of madness to them. I feel like there are analogies of this to many things in life, and it’s just a beautiful poetic detail of worldbuilding, again.<br/><br/>There’s also some of the most poetic, fitting endings for several of the characters. I love the ending of this book. Very satisfying.<br/><br/>I feel as if I have told you many things “about” the book but still conveyed nothing of how amazing it is to read it. Words really fall short. I will say that although the book is long, my attention never wavered, it really is always very intriguing and fun, a real relief to read something this well-written in comparison to most stuff out there. It’s just head and shoulders above the rest, and I can’t wait to re-read it again and again throughout the years.",,,1,0

I gave up everything for you! My husband, my lovers, my years and days and hours, my music, my capacity to love—gave them all away in exchange for toil, blood, and excrement! For you! For nothing! I’m all alone!”<br/><br/>Reading this book was worthwhile for the ending alone. The ending is inevitable; of course a book about pregnancy and rearing a child must end with the pain of when the child leaves the nest, thankless, and you have that existential crisis of identity: how could you not? This book made me think about how some of the most universal and painful life experiences that humans go through (pregnancy, and the overall relationship of a mother to her child) are experiences that I will never have, that I never can have. I feel oddly excluded, rather than relieved that I don’t have to go through all that. But enough about me.<br/><br/>What a strange book to start off the year with!<br/><br/>First let's get something out of the way. The premise of this book is that a woman is married to a man and gets pregnant with an owl child...because around the same time as having relations with her husband, she also has relations with a female owl.<br/><br/>Yeah. I know, I know. I know. I know...<br/><br/>Some people would have just stopped reading there. But I have this theory however, something I picked up from C.S. Lewis' book about The Reading Life, that you should read an entire book to the end to understand the author's intent. In other words, your boy Lewis never DNF'd anything, even things that he had major issues with. He withheld all judgment till the end.<br/><br/>Do I take that philosophy to the extreme? No, thankfully--I have DNF'd 6 or 7 books as of this writing. I think if I read a good 20-30% of a book and there's just absolutely nothing at all, no reason at all to keep reading, then yes I feel fine with throwing the book in the trash and walking away. But usually there is at least something that a book is doing well and that I can learn from. I try to take as humble a posture as possible in my reading life...difficult, because I am quite human and therefore can be egotistical, snotty, judgmental, and jump to conclusions...but it's my aspiration.<br/><br/>So I kept reading. And I'm glad I did. This style alone is so interesting and well done as to be worth studying. Somewhere between a fever dream and a myth, similar to magical realism but somehow more like reading a Raymond Carver; stark with description but perfect with its dialogue.<br/><br/>Furthermore there's a lot of body horror, there's themes of motherhood and pregnancy and estranged marriage relations and two cultures colliding, there's all sorts of strong themes in this little tight-punching book.<br/><br/>There are different interpretations of what it’s all about. Sometimes it seems like she’s caught between two forms of madness: her owl lover has the madness of the wild, and her husband has the madness of civilization. <br/><br/>Oftentimes it seems the main theme though is rather that her daughters condition is a metaphor for being born with various congenital disorders or neurodivergent traits and the author is saying: just because some people are born different doesn’t meant they’re born “wrong” and that they need to be fixed. <br/><br/>A big deal is made of the fact that the daughter is missing the milestones that have been appointed by a society of people who are different than them…yes they’re missing those milestones but in the meantime they are excelling in other areas. Yes her bones are brittle and she can’t eat with a spoon, but she doesn’t need a spoon, she can hunt and kill and eat her own prey, and she can glide across the room, an amazing trait that none of the “normal” people possess. Maybe her developmental plan should be different!<br/><br/>But while there are all of these themes to read into it, it also doesn't have to be about any of these other things. It's also just about itself; the story is the story. It's about learning to live with the alien, about oneness with something wild and at first disturbing, but being changed. It's about owls and what thinking, eating, and living as a nocturnal predatory bird is like. Sometimes disturbingly so. And last but not least, it's especially about the body horror of being pregnant with a writhing owl baby, which is disturbing—but perhaps only slightly more disturbing than the experience of pregnancy already is, if you think about it.<br/><br/>Having a spouse who is completely opposed to your child-rearing is also disturbing and a very difficult experience that many have gone through--I haven't personally, but we want to, my wife nannies, and it seems like all of our friends have kids, and so we think about kids and parenting about as much as one possibly can without actually having kids. We're thinking of adopting and/or fostering next year. But anyways.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read this. It's really hard to know how to rate this because sometimes it was a one, and sometimes it was a five. But that's life.<br/><br/>Some of the ""one"" moments included the sex with an owl parts and the way that the carnivore perspective was written about...I think it's interesting to think about a carnivore's perspective on life, but this was implemented in a very grotesque way...there is a bit of the grotesque to the way predators are, but I think the perspective deserved more nuance.<br/><br/>Ultimately what matters most to me about this book is how riveting, heartbreaking, shattering that the narrator's experience is to me. I felt so much, so viscerally in this book, even though I've literally never had any of the experiences of the narrator. Some of these passages hit me hard with those bittersweet moments that summarize so much of the grief of life. Let me leave you with some awesome excerpts.<br/><br/>“I’ve stared so long in the direction where you flew off that the sky over there looks fake, like cheap cloth, like a curtain. If I could reach out my hand and catch a corner of this curtain, then I would pull it away, Chouette, and here you would be, standing in front of me again.”<br/><br/>“I guess a bus may be back for me, or it may not, but either way I’m beginning to feel like it’s my turn.”",,,1,0

I pursue it. I love it.<br/><br/>So it’s been very strange to find myself actually having a hard time with a book because…it’s too intense. Major spoilers ahead, by the way—there’s no way to avoid them.<br/><br/>This book disturbed me in a way that none of Robin Hobb’s books have so far (although they have gotten progressively darker starting with Fool’s Fate). There is torture described in more detail than ever before and this time being done by the supposed hero of the story! That scene was sadistic. And there are several other messed up moments revolving around torture and macabre violence.<br/><br/>And more to the point: half of the book is overshadowed with the threat of rape to these two girls. One of them is raped and there’s also a scene where a whole bunch of people get raped and then there’s dealing with the fallout of that trauma. Point is: there’s a whole lot of rape and threat of rape.<br/><br/>On top of that, this book is also really intense because the second half of it is basically a play by play of a parent trying desperately to conduct a manhunt for their abducted child. That hit me hard. That content I have no objection to, it was just…emotionally hard for me personally. A year and a half ago I was conducting a manhunt for my father. It was a terrible, sinking feeling that culminated in discovering that he was, in fact, dead. I don’t have to explain much more than that.<br/><br/>Another thing about this book is that the first half is agonizingly slow, and slow during a period of time where you know that the hero’s daughter has been kidnapped but he doesn’t. And so he’s just going about normal life and there’s just a whole lot of freakin NOTHING going on for way too long when you know all along what has happened and that he needs to spring into action. It’s too prolonged.<br/><br/>There were absolutely great things about this boo, too. Of course we have familiar characters that we have come to love being developed upon. In particular, Lant, a young man, becomes much more interesting and likable by the end. I love how he is progressing. I like getting to know Lant and his perspective, so that his past actions make more sense and we’re able to relate to him more; without that understanding he just seemed like a selfish prick before. But now he’s a character I’m rooting for. It’s also good to see him being the young character cutting his teeth on his first adventure in contrast to Fitz who is probably (it feels like, at least) on his last one.<br/><br/>And there are some truly delightful moments, several of them. There are moments with Kettricken, the Fool, Riddle, Nettle. There is an upset to the old order of things, including one really major thing that I won’t spoil.<br/><br/>But I guess the main reason this isn’t a five star read for me is that the first half is too slow for the second book in a series, and it’s just too dark. I did not start off thinking of Robin Hobb as grimdark at all, but for some reason that seems to be exactly where she’s going and for me that just isn’t what I want to read in fantasy. I read fantasy to feel cozy, not horrified. And I value my headspace. I read all kinds of books that have all kinds of dark moments and people have to take time to heal from trauma which is something I’m very interested in (the healing part). <br/><br/>But I really especially didn’t like dwelling in this space of prolonged trauma, such as having the threat of rape hanging over you for half of a book. That just is terrible for me. I don’t know. I can appreciate the fact that there are people out there who have experienced exactly that. And that’s absolutely awful and their stories should be told. But telling their stories doesn’t mean we need to live in that prolonged state again and reproduce the trauma. That I don’t think is necessary or helpful.<br/><br/>So this is a weird place to be in. After being a Robin Hobb fanboy for all these years and reading through 11 of her books so far, I’m actually wondering if I’m going to continue and read that last one or not. If someone here has read it, let me know if you think it will bother me as much as Fool’s Quest did.<br/><br/>Will you like this book? If you like the characters from the previous books and the way that Robin Hobb does character development and you don’t mind the fact that this is one of her slowest books yet, if you want to see what happens next with Fitz and you crave intensity, then this is probably for you. That is my best recommendation.",,,1,0

Also though, she was expected to put out children and if she couldn’t do that he could get a second wife or concubine. There’s also several laws pertaining to when a woman dies, how her “marriage portion” is divided among her father or her children depending on other circumstances. It isn’t specified what the marriage portion is.<br/><br/>I found it interesting that although their roles were very gendered and women were certainly not treated equally, there certainly were many rights afforded to women that other ancient societies didn’t necessarily afford. I like how, if her husband dies, her children have to take care of her.<br/><br/>In the laws about property rights, three main possessions are listed repeatedly: a man’s garden, a man’s house, and a man’s field. These were fundamental and couldn’t be requisitioned to pay for his debts unless he was a foreigner.<br/><br/>All in all I think there is a lot here worth reading. It’s of great historical importance (the heavy influence it had on Mosaic Law is pretty apparent), and it only take an hour and a half. There’s an audiobook too.",,,1,0

The I-Ching was designed to be used for divination, which is where a question is answered through a process involving luck, with a spiritual belief that the outcome will be accurate. I don’t practice divination, but I still wanted to read this to learn all the wisdom therein. The I-Ching is the oldest significant work of Chinese literature. <br/><br/>In ancient times, commentary by Confucius was added to it, the ""Ten Wings."" This particular text that I read was a translation into English by Taoist Master Huang, who included not only those commentaries, but also his own commentary, all of which are invaluable for explaining the gua (the original texts) which are written as cryptic poetry which had meaning to ancient feudal Chinese readers, but many (if not most) of the meaning would be lost to us now (random example: I never would have guessed that crossing great rivers signifies undertaking dangerous activities). If you were to read the gua without explanation you would be mystified, but Huang explains everything very well so even a complete Westerner can understand it. <br/><br/>Some of what I found most interesting was the cosmology explained at the beginning of the book: yellow is the color of earth and blue the color of heaven, and when the two unite they generate a multitude of beings. Also, the significance of yin and yang is explored in great depth; the concept is much more sophisticated and interesting then my basic idea of it had been. These concepts that are taught at the beginning come up again and again as you read the 64 gua.<br/><br/>There are 64 gua because there are 8 different elements, and you get two elements, so 8x8=64. The elements are heaven, earth, water, fire, thunder, mountain, lake, wind/wood. (Yes: wood and wind are treated as the same element.) Each gua represents a particular stage of life or season and has wisdom on how to get through that season as well as possible. Some seasons appear to be wonderful, and the I Ching usually teaches caution in these cases. Some seasons appear to be terrible, and the I Ching usually teaches hope and perseverance in these cases—things will get better. In fact I would be amiss to not mention that the overarching theme of the I Ching is change. The only constant in life is change. And after things progress to their extremes, they then alternate to their opposites. This comes up again and again, and when reading the gua in order from 1-64 you can see the progression; Huang calls out why each one alternates to the next one.<br/><br/>While I’m not an expert on the different translations of the I-Ching into English, I can say this, Huang constantly puts in what the other translations named each gua and why he disagrees when he does. He also has a way of explaining things very thoroughly in a way that is satisfying. And he includes commentaries that other translations don’t, and that’s actually very important from what I can tell. Those commentaries bring a lot of life to the text. So I would recommend that anyone who is a Westerner who wants to read the I-Ching use this translation as it is simply very thorough and well-written.<br/><br/>So how good was the wisdom? Was it life-changing? I would say that it was often very insightful. I took a lot of notes. There were many parts that I didn’t really understand or that didn’t necessarily click for me, but every single gua always had at least a couple of parts that were really good to think about. This was well worth reading, although it was long! This translation is 500 pages, and they are big pages. So it’s not a quick read. But if you really want to delve into the history of ancient literature, I would say this is very rewarding.<br/><br/>The way these are written gives you inadvertent glimpses of what life was like in ancient China. Marshes were associated with joy, because these wide flat marshes were where an abundance of food was grown. Crossing great rivers was a dangerous event, to only be undertaken during auspicious times. Hunted game had three grades: the top grade was killed by shooting it through the heart and could be presented at offerings, the middle grade was hit in the legs and could be used at banquets, and the lowest grade was hit in the belly and could only be eaten by the person who killed it. Under the Shang dynasty, there were slaves, but King Wen abolished slavery, angering a lot of slave owners but ushering in a new era of productivity. On and on, there are hundreds of interesting facts you learn about this era that paint a full vivid picture of what life was like for these people thousands of years ago—for me that is a rich thing indeed to get to see. It isn’t all good; the I Ching’s view of gender is, well, really different than ours today. But I tried to not let that distract me from learning all I could from this work of art.<br/><br/>This morning I finished the I Ching, and it was a feeling of accomplishment and musing. Remember how the I Ching teaches that after things proceed to their extremes, they alternate to their opposites? The cycle of 64 gua begins with Initiating, which is all yang, followed by Responding, which is all yin. It starts off with alternating between extremes. At the end, the second-to-last gua is Already Fulfilled, followed by Not Yet Fulfilled. Both of these have three yin and three yang and every line alternates from the last one: they are the most perfectly balanced gua. But Already Fulfilled has all the lines in the “correct” places, whereas Not Yet Fulfilled has all the lines in the “incorrect” places. It was interesting that Already Fulfilled is not the ending of the cycle. Actually, it’s the second to last, because after fulfilling one goal, then one realizes that there is a completely new undertaking that must be focused on, and the last gua—Not Yet Fulfilled, which is a period of realizing that everything is wrong—leads directly into the beginning of the next cycle, the Initiating, the pure yang energy of heaven that pushes forward to make a new thing.<br/><br/>As always the advice in the last two gua was counter-intuitive on first glance, but makes sense when you think about it. Already Fulfilled is actually filled with warnings, because this is the stage when people become complacent; they have their goals fulfilled and there is nothing else to do. They become given to excess and indulgence. Not Yet Fulfilled is actually more auspicious than you would think; it is a time of trouble, and yet, because one is in a balanced place, one can move forward cautiously and know that, because the time is ripe for change, he will probably have great success moving forward.<br/><br/>Perhaps my biggest takeaway from reading the I Ching is a greater awareness of seasons of life than anything else I’ve ever read. I feel I have a lot more depth of understanding of the progression of life and how one should act in different circumstances—when to embrace pain, when to be cautious about joy, or when to do the opposite. There was a whole lot of interpersonal stuff in here too that I didn’t really touch on. But suffice it to say…this was a truly great book.",,,1,1

I found myself wondering this as I read it. The plot centers around a speculative scientific breakthrough that enables the main character (I won’t call him the “hero”) to transform his body into an alternate body, complete with an alternate personality and sense of morality. Obviously no such drug existed in Victorian times; in fact no such drug exists today, so it’s still science fiction by our own standards.<br/><br/>I say that no such drug exists today but actually, in a broader sense, as far as altering one’s personality, you could definitely say that alcohol does that for people. Furthermore, one of the hallmark signs of addiction is that it causes the addict to do things that he is normally morally opposed to, things that cause him great moral distress.<br/><br/>I happen to know a lot about alcoholism. I’m not an alcoholic, but I am part of a rich twelve step tradition that points to Alcoholics Anonymous as its origin. So I’ve read a lot of the AA literature throughout the years; in fact I read the “big book”, Alcoholics Anonymous, on a regular ongoing basis as a spiritual discipline. <br/><br/>So reading Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was of great interest to me. People have theorized for a long time on whether he was writing an allegory about bipolar disorder or alcoholism or something else. I don’t think it’s necessarily an allegory, but I will say that I think RLS had some insight into how alcoholics think and behave and how the progression works. As Jekyll describes his back and forth journey into indulging more and more in this dark pleasure, I can’t help but see clear parallels. He even uses a metaphor for the way “a drunk” behaves…RSL may have been ahead of his time in understanding alcoholism.<br/><br/>What else is this book? It’s a thriller, it’s chilling, and it has a mystery unraveling aspect for the first two thirds of the short book. Of course if you already know how it ends there is no mystery, but it is still interesting to try to piece together some of the strange things Jekyll does, like sending a message to a friend asking him to break into Jekylls quarters alongside Jekylls servant and then take out a certain box and hold onto it until an associate of Jekyll comes and asks for it. Why would he do that? I enjoyed trying to tease that one out.<br/><br/>But I don’t think this story is primarily about the mystery. I think it’s primarily (to me) about compartmentalization, addiction, progression into insanity, and in a broader sense, it’s a scientific version of the Faustian Bargain that is one of the great themes of literature. For that alone this is a wonderful read. I heartily recommend it.<br/><br/>As for whether it’s science fiction, I would say yes. To me it is science fiction at the core because it does what science fiction uniquely does well; it shows how science can affect our humanity and gets us to ask chilling questions that grapple with that sense of perverseness, the Uncanny Valley, the demon in the mirror.",,,1,0

However that is not necessarily a problem with the book itself, and in fact, probably suits it.<br/><br/>It was difficult for me to understand what, exactly, was the point. But I also understand that writers like Virginia weren't writing to necessarily convey a precise ""point.""<br/><br/>The prose is beautiful and the characters are elucidated more and more from start to finish, which I take it was one of the author's main goals. As I understand it another goal was to focus on person experiences, which may contradict other people's experiences of the same thing, and I would say this mostly succeeded, although I would think that the point could better have been made if there were a few instances of more clear-cut facts that were seen as one thing by one person, and another by another. It may be that there were such facts, but if there were I did not see them.<br/><br/>It was a little difficult for me to fully imbibe in everything that was being communicated. I think as I get older, my attention span for reading is gradually getting wider, and it may be that when I revisit this in five or ten years, I am able to more fully understand the entire experience.<br/><br/>I feel as if this first reading, for me, was an introduction to something I will enjoy greatly with re-reading. I already enjoyed it somewhat and have a feel for some of the points and nuances, but only a few. I really look forward to reading this again and again to glean the depths.",,,1,0

And they come back just at the right time to upset someone’s plans. Oh and before their identity is revealed, they fall in love with their sister. Gets you every time. Luke and Leia syndrome. Doh!<br/><br/>Menander is the greater Ancient Greek playwright you’ve never heard of. He was very prolific at about 100 plays or more, was considered the greatest of the comedic playwrights, and is the most frequently quoted playwright of the ancient world.<br/><br/>These plays are characterized by comedic turns, misunderstandings, and deceptions, usually in a very domestic setting, usually set outside two neighboring houses. There’s a lot of neighborly relationships (good and bad), weddings, and the like. <br/>Different bad actors are duly caricatured and mocked, they don’t get their way, everything ends happily, and a good time is had by all. Oftentimes the villain has a change of heart at the end.<br/><br/>The Bad Tempered Man<br/>This was funny. It’s about an old curmudgeonly fellow who wants everyone to get off his lawn, like, overly, comedically so. Everyone makes fun of him, kind of like “are you seeing this?” And then the guy falls into a well and gets rescued (albeit not before people have some talk about whether they should just leave him down there; joking/not-joking/but-no-really…). They haul him out of the well and he has a change of heart, realizing that we need each other (cue kumbaya). It’s basically A Christmas Carol. Quite funny though.<br/><br/>The Girl from Samos<br/>A man comes back from a long business trip to find out his son really wants to get married to his girlfriend, like, today... His son got the girl knocked up and she has had a baby. He tries to cover up the fact that they already had a baby and gets the servants to cover for him. The father has a (wife? Mistress?), Chrysis, who is from Samos…Samos was known for being a hotbed of prostitution. Chrysis got pregnant before her man left on this trip, and he had ordered her to lose the child. She miscarries, so problem solved. But then in order to cover for her step son having a child out of wedlock, she volunteers to take their child and take care of it. Her man thinks she disobeyed him but she claims that she just found the child in the wild. <br/><br/>So the son has his plan all in place…his stepmother is covering for him, so hopefully no one will find out that he got his girlfriend knocked up out of wedlock, so now if he can just convince his dad and father in law to let them get married right away, then the deed can be done before anyone is the wiser. (The girls father likewise starts off deceiver because he went on the long business trip with the boys father.)<br/><br/>Of course it backfires and they find out and it looks like all will be lost, but then there’s a reversal at the end and it ends happily. <br/><br/>None of this description conveys the comedic ways in which everything is delivered, but it is quite funny even in translation. <br/><br/>There are lots of well put saying as well; these plays are not as poetic as say Aeschylus, but there are lots of proverbial expressions that were coined by Menander and then quoted by others: in many ways he was a shaper of the culture.<br/><br/>There’s also a recurring theme throughout of these slaves getting put into terrible untenable situations, double binds through no fault of their own. I wonder if Menander was slyly pointing out how unfair and injust that slavery is? I’m not sure. But I get the feeling he may have been a forward thinker for his time.<br/><br/>The Arbitration <br/>A man is cross with his wife because when he comes home, he finds out from a slave that she got pregnant while he was gone and then gave birth. He feels ill used by his wife, goes and sleeps at a neighbor’s house and hires a prostitute to hang out with him. Meanwhile, a shepherd discovers a child that was left in the wilderness to die, complete with a ring. That shepherd is apprehended by the servant of the aforementioned man, who recognizes his master’s ring. The servant brings the child and the ring back to his master’s house but is afraid to tell him. Finally, the prostitute puts it all together and gets the man to admit that he took advantage of a woman at a recent festival. The prostitute recognizes the woman—she is the man’s very wife. The two are reconciled. It’s basically the plot of the Piña Colada song.<br/><br/>The prostitute also gets a happy ending because she gets pursued by the man’s friend that he’s been staying with, and can finally stop having to resort to prostitution to get by. Very nice.<br/><br/>The Shield<br/>A man goes off to war, hoping to come back with enough winnings so that his sister can have a good dowry. He goes with his faithful servant, but his servant comes back with a sad tale. He was separated from his master during a crucial battle. He found his masters bloated corpse with his shield next to it. He has come home with the shield alone, which his master spent so much time taking care of, but which failed to take care of him. <br/><br/>Of course, it’s revealed that his master didn’t actually die but got his gear mixed up with someone else, and because the corpses were swollen his servant couldn’t tell the difference. <br/><br/>His surprise return is instrumental in overturning the machinations of a dastardly neighbor Smikrenes (what a name) who wants to force a marriage upon a girl many years his junior just so he can get his greedy hands on that dowry. This would be particularly tragic since she was just about to marry a young man that she actually loves. Comedically, they trick Smikrenes into thinking that someone else has died and that his daughter (who has an even larger dowry) is up for grabs. At the end, both “dead” people are revealed to not be dead, the girl gets to marry who she pleases, and Smikrenes learns his lesson.<br/><br/>The rest of the plays have so many missing parts that the reconstructions of the plot are very speculative or not even possible.<br/><br/>Is this worth reading?<br/>I think so. You get a completely different view of Greek life, you can learn a lot about comedy, learn what day to day normal life was like, and also I found Menander championing slaves and prostitutes and other people who society deems “lesser” to be refreshing.<br/><br/>The main thing I’m sad about is that we don’t have more complete plays by him, which really detracts from this being as good as it could, though obviously that’s not due to any fault of the translators or anyone else.<br/><br/>Notes on scholarship<br/>Why have you never heard of Menander? Unlike the other great Greek playwrights he composed comedies, not tragedies, and this may be part of why he wasn’t held in as high regard—despite all of those quotations, he only won the title in the athenian drama festivals eight times out of those 100 plays. Nevertheless there is no denying his genius at composing comedic plots, at developing lively characters, and at crafting memorable lines. But you’ve never heard of him because unlike Sophocles or Euripides or Aeschylus, we don’t have a bunch of his surviving texts.<br/><br/>What we do have is one play that is almost complete and several plays that have large missing pieces and then tons of fragments and quotations. In recent years a lot more of his work has been discovered, and this text is the first time for much of the new discoveries to be captured in a solid translation and made accessible.<br/><br/>This book is organized helpfully, starting with the most complete plays and going from there with fragments at the end. I found the first few plays still pretty enjoyable because even when there are major pieces missing, the translator provides their best guess summary of what probably happened in that section based on inference, so the plot is still quite comprehensible. The fragments at the end are less interesting.",,,1,0

It is definitely an important thing to read. I have a better understanding of a lot of things now. This reads as a rallying call, especially the ending. There is also a very interesting section describing the communist party's relations to other political parties at the time. But probably the most interesting part is the beginning, the history of the world through the lens of class struggles. Marx is a master with words, and there are many passages that I noted to revisit and remember. He writes with grand, sweeping strokes that encompass huge areas. Sometimes this results in him seeming perhaps a bit too reductionist, but for the most part, somehow he gets away with it.<br/><br/>I think he was really onto something, but I disagree on one major point. He thought that the only possible solution for the unstable situation (where the bourgeoisie have power over the proletariat) was for the proletariat to get political power over the bourgeoisie. I think this is fundamentally too unstable. The bourgeoisie are, by definition, the proletariat's bosses. It doesn't work to be your boss's boss. Obviously, it also doesn't work for the bourgeoisie to have full power and the proletariat to starve, like what was happening across Europe in the 1840s. My theory is that the only stable solution is where the bourgeoisie and the proletariat share political power in a balance. And I think that if you look at the stable countries today--the ones that aren't dictatorships or oligarchies--they all have a mix of power being shared by these two classes.<br/><br/>There are no communist countries today, and perhaps never have or ever will be. The concept is fundamentally flawed in my opinion. The proletariat can't have all the political power for so many reasons. First, the bourgeoisie is naturally full of people who are good at managing, organizing, directing. That's how they got to be bourgeoisie. And they have experience on their side. The proletariat will never be able to compete in that area. Secondly, the bourgeoisie will never be content with not being in power because they are used to that. The best compromise can be to have them share their power, but to have them give it up completely? That's impossible to get them to agree to. And to simply completely do away with the bourgeoisie is also impossible. If you do get rid of them, then a new bourgeoisie rises up in their place, because someone has to manage. Marx advocated for centralizing power over capital in the state. In his model, the state simply becomes the new bourgeoisie. All of the bureaucrats that the state hires to run everything are now the new bourgeoisie and the same old problems arise. It just shuffles around the players.<br/><br/>Anyways. A totally different tact to take is to think about how to apply all of this to the modern world, which is quite a bit different from 180 years ago. In first world countries today, I don't know that the breakdown of proletariat and bourgeoisie really applies perfectly well to our society.

I read a hypothesis that every society must necessarily produce underground men.  <br/><br/>I've read some disagreements but my understanding of this archetype is, based on my reading of the book: a man/woman who recognizes his depravity in all sorts of actions due to powers of introspection and a commitment to truth, and yet is very willful and unable to simply stop these behaviors, but does not simply ignore or rationalize these (he may sometimes do that but he has lucid moments frequently and these make him miserable).  As such he is inherently miserable.  <br/><br/>His main problem is his willfulness.  The first half of the book is the protagonist soliloquizing, not so much a story as an essay that includes examples from his life that are little snippets of stories.  He uses these examples to argue several points, some of which I think we are meant to not necessarily agree with--I think he is an unreliable narrator, and this becomes even more obvious in the second half of the book--but the main point that he makes in the first half of the book that I find powerful is the idea of willfulness.<br/><br/>Basically, human wilfullness is irrationally wanting to get our will even when it's against our self-interests (money, respect, power, food, sex, etc, the things we naturally want).  This observation tears down the idea that if we could only provide all of mankind's physical needs then the world would be a utopia.<br/><br/>The second half of the book, Appropos of Wet Snow, is a story out of his life that shows in more plain relief just how willfull, petty, selfish, the character is.  It also shows a lot of great insights into social status problems.<br/><br/>I loved this book, it was a quick read actually, surpisingly, and a great delve into character and questions of human nature.",,,1,0

I've always found that description humorous and descriptive, although not necessarily super fair. Gaskell was a contemporary of Jane Austen and wrote about romance and high society. <br/><br/>As for the communism, it's halfway true. It’s more about the origin of the idea of the capital holding rich having for the first time a relationship with labor unions that isn’t completely antagonistic, that is a little bit more complementary. This makes the books political stance distinctly socialist; not communist, by the definitions set forth by Karl Marx.<br/><br/>The setting is Dickensian, a polluted city full of commerce and soot, with poor downtrodden workers struggling to survive. <br/><br/>Our heroine, Margaret, is unusually empathetic and a strong peacemaker. She’s one of favorite characters from any book I have read in this era. She is a newcomer from the country, new to an industrialized environment. The daughter of a parson, she is used to visiting the poor and doing as much good as she can to help people understand each other. She vaccilates between the world of the poor and the rich, between the workers who are striking for their rights, and the family of John Thornton, one of the mill owners. <br/><br/>Unlike many a book that has been written on social and economic injustice, this one is actually interesting. Gaskell doesn't strawman either side, and in fact explores each quite thoroughly, showing different individuals, factions, and viewpoints inside of each side. Through her heroine Margaret, she seeks to find common ground, an art form all but lost during that time period...<br/><br/>And sadly, it's all but lost today. Would that more people thought like Margaret. It's such a rare gem to find meaningful discourse, seeking to understand, searching for common ground, unifying instead of dividing. To do the work of a peacemaker is really hard work, and often thankless. Many people will say that if you're not for us you're against us. That's where we are in American politics today; the moderates are attacked by both sides, torn apart like a sheep among wolves. But nevertheless...I digress, but the point is, Gaskell is doing something really interesting in this work that is healing to my soul.<br/><br/>The heroine, Margaret, is one of my favorites. She's strong, imperfect with her impetuousness and a touch of (unintentional) haughtiness. But she's strong, a unifying force, someone with a higher perspective.<br/><br/>Her biggest flaw is probably her haughtiness—she thinks of herself as “Someone,” for she comes from minor nobility and there are all sorts of Victorian concepts of what all that entails. Because of that she can be seen as more a product of her environment and when contextualized, she’s ahead of the curve—her maid Dixon actually gets more offended for the family’s sake than her family does, which makes for a comedic twist.<br/><br/>The comparison with Jane Austen is inescapable, and in many ways this is similar; these are rich nobility during the same time period having some of the same dinner parties and concerns. But here we have a lot of the poor’s perspective too. And where Austen's novels are really only about romance with only a dash of other topics, Gaskell's novel is about romance but is also truly about at least two other things. One is the coming of age story which is quite strong here; I won’t say more than that for fear of spoiling things for you. The other is a searching for resolution to war between those with capital and those without. And this is far from the demonizing, revolutionary talk of the Communist Manifesto. The tone is more similar to Charles Dickens (fitting since he was a mentor of Gaskell’s). It’s more a perspective of really seeing the plight of the working poor with great pathos, really seeing it.<br/><br/>And Gaskell also seeks for us to really understand Thornton. Far from falling into the pit of ""all rich people are scumbags,"" she explores his psyche in insightful detail. She shows what many people overlook, which is that someone like Thornton came to be where he was precisely because of admirable traits: because of how capable, determined, hardworking, creative, and industrious he was, precisely because he could see and understand things that few do. It also shows his examples of charity and kindliness, much of which Margaret draws out, but which was quite latent before she entered his life.<br/><br/>She also doesn't deify the rich as I have seen some books do. In fact, Thornton and  especially his mother have become a bit monomaniacal, and it's love for Margaret that helps free John from his crusty shell and connect with his heart again.<br/><br/>I also loved reading this for the characterizations. Everyone seems to be basically a caricature...but a well-done caricature. I feel like they are epitomized representations of certain archetypes; distilled forms. They make me feel things. Mostly palm-to-forehead things. But things nonetheless, because they feel like Gaskell is making fun of things that need to be made fun of.<br/><br/>I like how Gaskell sets up a pretty huge hurdle for the love story to overcome. The Thorntons basically think Margaret is a complete snob. And that misunderstanding makes sense in context; it illuminates the suspicion that the new money has for being looked down upon by old money, which is another major theme. You see what you expect to see. Well done.<br/><br/>Quibbles? Well, as in all Victorian romances, it ends immediately with engagement. The two lovers haven’t spent any time really getting to know each other in depth. That’s always puzzled me about these books.<br/><br/>I also have other quibbles with the ending feeling a bit rushed, and it taking is a bit too long in the middle to get there. The pacing could have been a bit better.<br/><br/>Overall? I strongly liked this book. I liked it even more than the Jane Austen I have read so far…with that said I haven’t read the great P&P or Emma yet so that could change…but I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. I’m looking forward to reading more of Gaskell.",,,1,0

(Most ancient plays are lost to the dusts of time.) The two bodies of work we have are: A) the Orestia, a complete trilogy, and B) 4 other random plays that were all part of a trilogy, but since we don't have the other plays in those trilogies, that makes our understanding of them not as complete.<br/><br/>This is composed of four plays: The Suppliant Maidens, Persians, Seven Against Thebes, and Prometheus Bound.<br/><br/>The Suppliants is one of the first plays ever. Back in this era, the chorus was the main character. That was dropped pretty quickly, but it's just interesting to me that that's even what the convention/rule was for a while. It also has an interesting historical bent, where it reveals some of the ancient interminglings between the Egyptian and Greek bloodlines.""<br/><br/>The Persians is remarkable: it’s written for a Greek audience about their enemies, and it casts the audience’s enemies in such a sympathetic light as has perhaps never been done since.  The Greeks had just beaten the Persians at the Battle of Marathon. The terrible misfortunes that befell the Persian army one after another is riveting to read about in verse.<br/><br/>This was a war between freedom (democracy) and slavery to the Persians. Aeschylus himself had fought in the war against the Persians. So for them to cast the Persians in such a sympathetic light, for them to actually empathize with how hard the news must have struck the Persians that they had lost, to go so strongly against nationalistic fervor and transcend that, is quite amazing. Having sympathy for your enemy is one of my highest spiritual goals. I wish I could have seen how the Athenians reacted to this play!<br/><br/>Seven Against Thebes is about the seven champions who assaulted the seven gates of Thebes when they tried to take the city. It's notably lacking in plot or much modern interest, but has some beautiful descriptions nonetheless. But it was very forgettable.<br/><br/>Prometheus Bound is interesting. It's the easiest to read, also quite strange: it’s about Hephaestus, alongside Might and Violence, binding Prometheus to a rock as punishment from Zeus for giving man fire and other technologies. It’s an underdog story where all the characters are gods.<br/><br/>At first it was always denigrated as being too bombastic and for the fact that all of its characters are essentially gods or otherwise totally unlike man. However, interest in it has been revitalized and it's now considered a great work. I found some of its passages to be the most beautiful and striking; there is zero plot, but I'm glad that I read it.<br/><br/>Considering how ancient that these plays are, I consider it amazing that Aeschylus developed his themes so strongly, and the evocative imagery he uses that have been reused ever since also make these plays a reflection of his greatness. While reading these fragmented plays is not the most satisfying experience, I would recommend reading Persians especially, although I would still place the Oresteia far above these others.<br/><br/>If only we had the full trilogies that these plays were taken from, they could be much more meaningful. I imagine in particular that Prometheus Bound could be the first act in a trilogy where Heracles comes and unleashes him later. I also would love to see how Persians fits into the bigger trilogy that it was taken from.<br/><br/>Aescyhylus, I tip my hat to you. Thank you for being one of the great forerunners of history who started so much.",,,1,0

This book was nothing like I imagined it.<br/><br/>The ancient Greeks had two dominant schools of thought: the stoics and epicureans. Similar to how we have two main political parties in the USA and then constellations of other parties that, as independent as some of them try to be, are mostly seen in light of the two largest parties, that is my impression of what the clout of various Greek schools of thought had: stoicism and Epicureanism were the two main schools, and all the others—skepticism, hedonism, cynicism, etc.—were cast in light of those two.<br/><br/>How do stoicism and Epicureanism differ? They both ostensibly believed in the gods, they both believed in moderation (a quintessentially Greek ideal), and both were concerned with the question of how to live the best (most virtuous) life. But while the stoics believed in denying one’s emotions to do that, the epicureans believed in making decisions based on what would provide the most pleasure.<br/><br/>But that doesn’t mean what you think it means. First of all, contrary to what you might think, Epicurus didn’t advocate for enjoying the finest foods or the most sex or any of that; those were the Hedonists, and he was quite opposed. He actually advocated that if you only ate bread and water for your food, that was the best way to be happy, because then you would always be able to find what you were looking for and be satisfied.<br/><br/>Also, Epicurus defined pleasure in the negative: an absence of pain. Every source of positive pleasure must be weighed against how much pain it will produce later; every decision must be looked at from the long view of how it affects the individual. So getting drunk is seen as having the benefit of increasing pleasure at the time of drinking, but Epicurus would say that that decision would be morally wrong because the physical and/or emotional pain from the fallout would be greater than the pleasure of the drinking. I’m sure some people would disagree with him on that point, and to them he would probably say great: in that case, for you, it is morally imperative that you DO drink. <br/><br/>Yes, that’s a weird thing to wrap your head around: Epicurus based his system of ethics, of right and wrong, on what produces the most pleasure-minus-pain, over the long run, for the individual making the decision. This leads to the main “flaw” in his theory that led to it not being more widely adopted by politicians etc, because his philosophy was seen as rather solipsistic. That being said, he was a precursor to the idea of the social contract (the idea of how selfishly motivated people could form a mutually beneficial society based on recognizing that if we all abide by certain rules then it will benefit all of us—I’m butchering it but you get the point) that was later expounded by Thomas Hobbs over a thousand years later. <br/><br/>In fact, Epicurus is striking for how groundbreaking he was. He claimed to be building from scratch, relying on no one that came before him, much like David Hume, who fittingly also ties to Epicurus through the philosophy of empiricism.<br/><br/>Epicurus was a truly original thinker. He was very important in the philosophical field of epistemology (the philosophy of how we know things; vital for the history of science) and can be seen as a forerunner of materialism, humanistic ethics, and empiricism.<br/><br/>When was empiricism invented? There were great empiricist philosophers (starting with David Hume) in the enlightenment period, but in reality, the idea of determining what is true not based on intuitive ideas and reasoning, but rather on keen observation, was not new to them. They were building on Aristotle. And Aristotle, as it turns out, was merely iterating on Epicurus.<br/><br/>Another notable section of this book is fascinating because Epicurus developed most of the Greek thought on atoms (fundamental, indestructible particles), not Democritus, who did little more than come up with the basic idea. Epicurus developed a lot of good thoughts on it, and I wonder how he was able to be so accurate before they had electron microscopes/etc.<br/><br/>But I get ahead of myself. What exactly is this book?<br/><br/>Epicurus wrote over 300 treatises. Unfortunately almost all of them are lost to us, even his most major treatise (On Nature) and The Major Epitome (a condensed summary he wrote of On Nature). What we do have is parts of The Minor Epitome, a couple of letters that outline how his philosophy applies to specific concepts, a collection of quotes, and other peoples writings about him (most notably Laertius). This book is a collection of the best of those sources and had a lengthy introduction and lots of very enlightening end notes to help fill in gaps and understand his philosophy as a whole hand I’m eternally grateful for the scholars who put it together. <br/><br/>Although one thing I wish they would have done differently is reversed the order of the writings. They have laid this book out so that you have pages and pages of Epicurus going on about solar eclipses and atoms before you get to the more interesting and broader ethics.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the funniest thing about Epicurus! His goal was to provide people with mental peace of mind. That was what he considered the good life. Again when he talks about living a life in pursuit of pleasure, remember that he mostly considered the highest state of “pleasure” to be the absence of all pain. So far so good right? But it gets funny when you look at what he found necessary to do that.<br/><br/>So what are the types of pain we want to be free of, Epicurus? Well, we want to be free of physical pain. So he espoused eating a plain diet of bread and water, instead of pursuing richer fare and then experiencing pain whenever it could not be found. Ok, very interesting. What other types of pain? Well there’s the consequences of doing something illegal or hurtful to someone else: going to jail, being fined, having people slander you, etc. Ok. <br/><br/>And finally, there’s another type of pain which he found it very important to eliminate: the pain of not believing that the natural world is strictly materialistic and deterministic. Huh? He believed that peoples superstitions about the gods causing weather events or misfortunes etc caused great distress. And so he goes into great detail about trying to prove that lightning is likely not caused by Zeus throwing bolts around, but by natural phenomena. Which is interesting. But what’s really interesting is how essential he considered these beliefs to be to having peace of mind. He goes on and on at great length about all kinds of natural science topics (atoms and meteorology esp.) but not because it’s interesting…because that would violate one if his beliefs, that one should not indulge in curiosity…so instead he argues that it’s “necessary” to prove these things so that we don’t lie awake all night worrying about why the recent solar eclipse happened. Lol, my dude. <br/><br/>Regardless of how many people were lying awake worrying about eclipses (which, admittedly, people in ancient times did attach great portent to), he was a bit of a forerunner in the realm of natural sciences. He came up with multiple plausible explanations for different weather phenomena, some of which were stunningly close to the mark—he didn’t have the scientific instruments we have today but he was a very keen observer and clear thinker. Where direct evidence was lacking he would look for examples and precedents to back every theory of the natural world because one of his missions was to overturn the idea that the gods caused weather events.<br/><br/>So in summary: this book is nothing like what you think. There is a section of getting into the ethics and advice on how to actually live a happy life. Most of it’s about atoms swerving and natural sciences, to “put our minds at ease.” He was as close to atheist as you could stand to be in a time where everyone was supposed to be reverent of the gods. He was supposedly very pious with all the festivals/etc., but in his philosophy he relegates the gods to being basically laws of nature, deterministic, nothing like what we think of as a “god.”<br/><br/>I’m sad that so much of Epicurus’s original writings were lost. This detracts from the enjoyment of the work, although obviously that is no fault of the translator. I found the translation to be highly readable. I’m glad I read this, but it’s just an incomplete experience. I wish I could have read his main treatises.",,,1,0

Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion are two parts that Dan Simmons wrote to be experienced as one story and had to split into two for publishing-industry reasons. Which is fine. But if you don’t know that going into it, then the ending of this book is going to feel like there are tons of open ends…because there are. Now, setting that aside…<br/><br/>I adored this book. It’s so beautiful and satisfying. You probably already know that! I feel like I’m possibly the last person on earth to read this modern classic of science fiction. This is literary science fiction at its best: a fascinating world, a large cast of very memorable characters, a great premise, beautiful prose perfectly balanced with action, not a word of tropeyness, just literary goodness blended so well that I could keep eating a whole bucket of this; I had to force myself to stop and take breaks!<br/><br/>The structure of the book riffs off of the Canterbury Tales: a group of disparate individuals travel together and each night a different one of them shares a story from their life. You have a colonel, a poet, a scholar, a priest, a consul, a detective, and the master of a great tree ship.<br/><br/>Each of their stories reveals a different slice of the vast universe that Dan Simmons has obviously spent an immense amount of time crafting. And it’s not just that the world he’s crafted is so big or impressive, it’s that the specific ideas he comes up with are so striking and so capture the imagination. <br/><br/>For instance there’s a scene where they encounter the edge of a sea of grass, and Simmons does such a good job of describing it in ocean terms that I can really see it, and imagine looking out over it and getting a similar but different experience to looking at the ocean. And then there’s the wagon ship that shows up, which has a massive wheel on its underside which lets it travel over the six foot tall grass, keeping its passengers safe from the massive serpents hiding beneath. The ship has huge sails that self adjust to catch the wind and propel them across the sea towards their final destination.<br/><br/>He’s obviously a master world builder who captures the imagination, but he has also done a great job of limiting himself and only revealing details of the world as they become relevant to the plot, never infodumping you. Every page is interesting, plot driven, and character revealing. It’s just so good.<br/><br/>It also has probably one of the most memorable characters of all science fiction: The Shrike! The Shrike is a forbidding creature about nine feet tall made of a thicket of metallic spikes. It lives on the world of Hyperion and mysteriously murders people, appearing and vanishing with ease. No military attempts, offensive or defensive, has ever had a modicum of effect against the Shrike. It is one of the universes great mysteries. Some people regard it as a god, others a demon or monster. There is a cult that worships it. <br/><br/>The plot of the book is that the Shrike has gone on a killing spree much more intense than ever before, and it’s killings are no longer geographically bounded to the part of the planet near the mysterious Time Tombs that it is associated with. Almost the entire population of millions of people on the planet is trying to flee. Everyone except for our band of misfits, who are going straight into the eye of the storm, under the auspices of the Hegemony, a pan galactic government.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, it’s revealed that each one of them already has a personal connection to the Shrike, the nature of which comes out in their stories. Each story reveals more about the Shrike as well as expounding on other mysteries such as the Time Tombs, an area around which time, or entropy, seems to flow backward.<br/><br/>The overarching story is actually a pretty good one (which often isn’t the case in books like these). And in addition I enjoyed each of the short stories inside of it. The poet’s story is funny and irreverent and quite insightful about the book publishing industry. The colonel’s story is a romance of sorts; it’s good but be warned there is a graphic sex scene, and it turns gruesome to boot. The scholar’s story is told from a father’s perspective and is heart wrenching. <br/><br/>And each of these stories, by the way, reveal really fascinating different things about the Shrike, things which invite you to think for yourself, to decide for yourself what the Shrike is and represents. It’s so well done.<br/><br/>And there are so many other stories interwoven into the greater story. It’s fascinating to see how the people of Jewish and Islamic faiths continue in exile even after their holy cities on old Earth have been destroyed.<br/><br/>It’s really cool to see how in the private detective’s story, Dan has really built upon ideas in Necromancer and made them more evocative and powerful.<br/><br/>With the detective’s story, I love that by wrapping it in a murder mystery, he makes me care about learning all about the Data Core, this collective of AIs that is off doing its own thing separate from humanity. It’s like he always manages to wrap all the learning about he works in the most palatable way, like delicious tacos that I just keep downing.<br/><br/>And I also love that you discover the AIs are doing some whacky things, like recreating old Earth on a faraway planet, and creating facsimiles of certain Old Earth poets…it gets really interesting. No, you don't need to know anything about poetry to enjoy this. And unlike some other authors, Dan manages to do a great job of, even though he’s continually raising new questions, he does manage to answer some as well.<br/><br/>I can’t wait to read the next book in this series.",,,1,0

I enjoyed getting to experience the lieutenant whose uniform is in rags and has over the last two years of living alone descended into various neuroticisms. I enjoyed getting to know two characters who are Ministers. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The MC is distinct and decent enough. Cheeky but not really funny.<br/><br/>There are many aspects of the work building that are really interesting and well thought out. The Ministers have different bodies that have adapted to space living and subsequent differences in their culture and mannerisms. They have a unique language type that uses a system of shining light with different patterns and colors.<br/><br/>I love all the weird mutated species in this book and how horrifying some of them are.<br/><br/>And yet despite those cool things, this was not a fun read. I finished it because I wanted to see the author expound on the different world building ideas but actually reading this was unfortunately painful. And the sad thing is, I feel 90% of the problems were totally preventable. I don’t lay the blame at the author’s feet, I lay it at the publisher’s. This is the authors debut novel and I know how hard it is to produce something like this. First drafts are always rough. This just didn’t get any beta readers or editing!<br/><br/>Before I rant, here is the premise. The main character is a linguist nerd (which is a field I’ve taken several classes in) and ostensibly the book is going to explore the theme and implications of immortality. The premise is that a group of criminals are given a job to extract the data with the secret of immortality from a spaceship that’s been abandoned for thousands of years and is next to a dying star about to go supernova.<br/><br/>This data is called the Philosopher’s Stone (the key to immortality) and it’s a big deal to find it, imagine what this discovery could mean for humanity…but from early on there are these people called Ministers who are stated to be immortal. So that begs the question, who are these Ministers? Are they not human? Are they aliens or robots? It’s not explained what they are but they are certainly quite humanoid. The story progresses along with several of the main characters being Ministers and playing large in the plot, but the narrator refuses to explain what they are to us. And that’s a big problem because their existence undermines the whole premise. Apparently these ministers already have the key to immortality so then why is it a big deal for humanity to find the philosophers stone? Why would the ministers have that secret but the humans who are very similar don’t? Then, a third of the way through the book we have a “big revelation” that it turns out that the Philosopher’s Stone project on this ship was what birthed the ministers…you can tell that this is supposed to be a “big reveal” but it just doesn’t work.<br/><br/>Another big thing sloppily done is that the style seems like it’s supposed to be scary but never is. The horror isn’t horrifying even though there are pretty gnarly creatures revealed. I never once got a rising sense of dread even though bad things were coming in the dark. I don’t think the author has figured out yet how to write horror, how to build tension.<br/><br/>And then there are all sorts of other things done sloppily. The bad guys are pushovers, the setup is too tropey, obvious questions aren’t answered, there are flashbacks that feel completely random and unnecessary, not at all connected to the plot…when you’re in an active combat scene, the good guys have way too much time to talk and do all kinds of complicated things.<br/><br/>I didn’t buy two of the twists and there were two big coincidences late in the book. Spoilers ahead but, one of the main characters reveals once we are most of the way through the book that he just so happened to be the general in charge of assaulting the MC’s home planet. Really, the one person in the whole universe just happened to end up here?<br/><br/>There’s a scene where someone shoots a hole in the hull of the spaceship and a character is “sucked out to space” and half of their body burned by a star’s radiation…but then suddenly they are back in the spaceship and it’s said that there was only ever a small hole shot in the hull that a different character patched quickly. So what gives? Half of your body was fried by radiation from a tiny hole? Also the other character was unscathed?<br/><br/>Also a big part of the premise is that a star is about to go nova so they are racing against the clock to get the data out in time. So many books get really unscientific with this topic. Stars going nova is a process that takes millions of years to lead up to. You’re not going to be able to time when it happens down to the year let alone the minute and second like they do in this book! And then the idea that you can see it go nova but then you have time to outrun the shockwave…I highly doubt that that’s at all accurate.<br/><br/>Ok. I could go on and on about the problems. I actually originally compiled a huge list. But I don’t want to beat a horse to death. Here’s the thing. I’m a writer, and I’ve hosted a writers group and worked with many writers for 6-7 years now. This book would have been an amazing first draft. Or even third draft especially considering this is a debut novel! And writing a book like this is like really really complicated. There are a lot of things the author is doing well! It’s just that you have to put your book through the rounds of beta readers and multiple layers of editing starting with developmental edits and going from there. And it appears that this book just skipped all that. I think the author didn’t get the support they needed. Anyways. I don’t post reviews to revel in bashing things. I really don’t. I don’t think there’s anything funny about mocking or taking a book down to size the way many reviews do. It’s not been my intention to be mean in any way with this review and I hope that my intent shows. I think the author has a lot of great ideas and I would be open to reading the next book of theirs—provided it’s been edited, which is usually pretty apparent in the first thirty minutes—because I would enjoy getting to know their universe more. That’s all for now.",,,1,0

Actually maybe even too much research really, because at a certain point, you’re just sifting through mountains of data on topics that were only very tangentially related to the plot. I think the author could have spent time more wisely by doing half the research and using that time to write another whole book about something else.<br/><br/>What’s great about this book? The transcripts, word for word, of the last phone calls and emails of the crew of Fargo, their last communication before they left this planet for great void beyond. It’s kind of chilling to know you are reading that. It’s also interesting to see the play by play of what series of events lead up to a huge US merchant ship going down in the 21st century? By the end of it you have a pretty good idea of exactly why this happened. It’s also interesting to see how the search, recovery, and investigation went as they tried to piece everything together.<br/><br/>What’s not great? Reading about the history of the merchant marine. And the history of the coast guard. And the history of every single government agency involved. And of every single side character’s mother’s brother’s cousin. Listen, I don’t need to know, every time you introduce a new character, their life story, literally starting with childhood what led them to become a sailor, who were all the members of their family, what were their family dynamics, what kind of town did they grow up in, where do they live now, what does each of their friends think about their decision to be a sailor, like literally, please just stop. This is one of very very few books where I just started skipping massive chunks of chapters and even full chapters.<br/><br/>Im guessing that the author was trying to make these individuals come alive so we would care about them when they die. I think that could have been done more effectively in 1/20th the time. Just a couple of endearing details about a person can get me to care a whole lot. Mountains of information does very little to move me.<br/><br/>So anyways, that gripe aside, it was still an interesting book, and I would say if you are curious about how a huge ship could go missing and crash in the modern age then this is worth reading, but just feel free to skip the backstories.",,,1,0

50732671,Apeirogon,Colum McCann,"McCann, Colum",,"=""030787804X""","=""9780307878045""",5,4.25,Random House Audio Publishing Group,Audio CD,15,2020,2019,2021/01/02,2021/01/14,"favorites, featured","favorites (#3), featured (#3)",read,"This was refreshingly good.<br/><br/>The book is structured in a unique way that I quickly fell in love with. There are no proper chapters. The book is composed of sections that are titled with numbers and do not have a page break between them. They are numbered from 1 to 500, and then from 500 to 1. There are 1,000 of them, a callout to the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. The sections are most often a few paragraphs, but can oftentimes be a single sentence and occasionally be many pages.<br/><br/>Each section is like a fragment of glass, and each fragment overlaps other fragments such that a beautiful composite emerges as you step back and gaze. This technique is masterfully employed to communicate a sense of his meaning very often. It helps you know where to stop and to think, where to consider something in its own right, and what’s important. He exploits all the uses of this form.<br/><br/>Here’s a very small example of what I mean. The second 457: “In Jewish tradition it is forbidden to throw away writings invoking the name of God. Prayer books. Scrolls. Encyclopedias. Garments. Tefillin straps. Even pamphlets or cartoon books. Instead of being destroyed, the texts are interred in a genizah, a burial place for the written word.”<br/><br/>And then later in 454, there is a story of Rami discovering orthodox Jews dumpster-diving in a genizah. A boy’s friends hold him upside-down by his ankles as he grabs the books. This is because it is forbidden to tread on the word G-d. <br/><br/>And then later in 444, this passage: “Sometimes Rami would step into Smadar’s [his dead daughter’s] room and think of it as a sort of genizah too.”<br/><br/>This book is about an unlikely friendship between an Israel, Rami, and a Palestinian, Bassam. These two are real people and McCann went to great lengths in his research of them.<br/><br/>In fact he has gone to great lengths in his research on a myriad of topics that went into this book, including the Holocaust, birds, the Arabian world, Islam, Jerusalem, the West Bank, the partitioning of Palestine/Israel, the history of the State of Israel and subsequent wars, and many other tiny details that he explores in fascinating depth. He takes details about all kinds of things—the death of Kalashnikov, inventor of the AK-47—the way the Israeli government handles honoring victims on Memorial day—the factories that create the explosives put into suicide bomber jackets—the adoption of the hoopoe as the official bird of Israel—the assassinations of Palestinian literary figures—anything and everything—and places these details in juxtaposition to other details just so that the reader can make all sorts of connections, gain new perspective.<br/><br/>We are told lots of facts, but because of the way the facts are put next to each other, we can step frequently into the world of concepts and philosophy in powerful ways. It’s the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>The thing that binds Rami and Bassam together is that each of them has lost a daughter to the conflict. They are part of a group of Israelis and Palestinians that were former combatants but now fight for peace. Out of a desire to hold contradictions together, they name themselves Combatants for Peace.<br/><br/>“It slowly dawned on Bassam that the only thing they had in common was that both sides had once wanted to kill people they did not know.”<br/><br/>Rami and Bassam become friends and end up touring the world together, speaking to all kinds of people—they even eventually go to Germany, a place Rami had previously been terrified of and sworn he would never visit.<br/><br/>The nature of constantly telling their stories—the stories of losing their daughters—is explored from several angles. Here’s an excerpt that is probably the first time it is talked about: “He began to understand that it wasn’t a performance. His was a beginning without an end. There was nothing theatrical about it at all. He could make of it whatever heaven or hell he wanted. He settled into the repetition: it was his blessing and his curse.”<br/><br/>Did I mention that Bassam, the Palestinian, is a holocaust researcher? And that Rami’s wife, Nurit, is an outspoken liberal Israeli against the occupation? This book is full of interesting characters. It gives you a slice of the life of each of the men’s wives as well as some of their children and several other interesting Israeli or Arabic figures in history.<br/><br/>The name of this book, apeirogon, means: “a polygon with a countably infinite number of sides.” That is exactly what this book is. He shows so many people’s perspectives. I love that. This is one of the things that books do better than any other medium: getting you inside other people’s perspectives.<br/><br/>Did I also mention that the author has a fascination with birds and tells countless stories and facts about them? The area is the world’s second-busiest migratory highway. More than 500 million birds pass through every year.<br/><br/>Did I mention that another theme is the book One Thousand and One Arabian Nights? And another theme is Borges’ idea about the Aleph, a point in space that contains all other points? This book has so many great themes that are expounded on, layer by layer, drip by drip.<br/><br/>I can’t say enough to praise this book. When I read the blurb I was worried that the author would come down on one side of the conflict or another. It seems so inevitable that when you talk about the Middle East people can’t help but be biased. I was very impressed by how much McCann works to not do that. But this book also wasn’t just a reporter writing a bunch of facts. I’ve read books like that…boring. This was anything but. This was delectable. And poignant. But never saccharine or melodramatic. This was so many things. It has ministered to my heart. I am very grateful for it.<br/><br/>I have read that Steven Spielberg has bought the rights to make this into a movie, although there are currently (as of this writing) no actual movie filming plans yet. That’s interesting. I hope he makes a good movie, and I’ll probably watch it, but to be honest, this is one of those books that—sure, you could make a movie using its themes—but you’ll never make a movie that gives you anything like the experience of reading this book. Some things are made for the medium of the written word.<br/><br/>In order to avoid waxing too long or dramatically, I will simply end the review here, saying I heartily recommend it; I savored it and look forward to re-reading this for years to come. This book is one of my treasures and I will cherish it.",,,1,0

I was very curious to pick this up because I’m really into the idea of exposing kids to science ideas early on and getting that sense of wonder going in that direction, and what better way to do it than through science fiction? Nevertheless there’s a lot of difficulties inherent in introducing kids aged 8-10 to the sci-fi genre, and I was really curious to see how the author would approach it.<br/><br/>The heroine is Chloe, who is a cloud. She can shapeshift her body however she wants to. I thought that this choice was a rather brilliant one, as clouds are a more relatable thing that have excited all kids’ wonder at some point, and having a character with a malleable body is a cool way of introducing other science fiction concepts later on that I’m very interested in exploring in my own science fiction writings: what happens if and when humans can significantly alter their bodies? Or even port their consciousness to totally different kinds of bodies, or existing in a state with no concrete body at all? How is this going to affect our senses of identity and what it means to be human? These, I feel, are the most fascinating questions to consider in this fascinating point that we are at in history.<br/><br/>The plot is that Chloe and her cat Louie (the two of them have a very fun relationship btw) embark on a quest to help their friend, Rainbow Oak, to create dancing flying daisies for a birthday present for his friend Willow.<br/><br/>One theme is the power of ideas and how to develop them. Another is why you need a robust team of other friends who will help you with many different specialties. Another is the theme of learning, being a child and asking questions and growing up. Finally, there’s a sense of wonder and magic throughout.<br/><br/>Along the way, they travel far and wide to meet different friends who help them learn a series of things: first about the ideation/product development process (which is wonderfully simplified so that any kid can understand). I loved this part; I had never seen this done in a kids book! Showing how to do ideation and then come up with a list of most important capabilities was really cool. There’s also an example later in the story where they run into a technical issue and have to challenge one of the vital capabilities(requirements), find a way to obviate the requirement, which I thought added a dash of realism to how the messy process goes in real life.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, they get some other friends to help them understand DNA and from there understand how to create new DNA by starting with different existing species and modifying them. This is the hairiest hardest part of the book I think for kids to get. I think if I was reading this to a kid, their eyes would glaze over.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the story is pretty digestible for a kid—at least I think it is; it should be noted I didn’t have a kid available to test this book on—but it’s fun and the voices done in the audiobook are evocative without being terribly annoying. There’s a lot of fun things in here about lands of sugar pies and fantastical furry animal friends and all the things that I think would make it more engaging for kids; although I do wonder if some boys would consider themselves too cool and tough for the more sanguine parts.<br/><br/>So all in all I think this is a pretty solid kids book. I look forward to testing it out on kids of my own when my wife and I one day produce or acquire them (lol). I suspect it would work best at ages 8-12. I think the bits about DNA in the middle that are hard to comprehend are fine actually, I think kids will just gloss over that part at first, not fully understanding, and that’s ok. If the story as a whole captures their attention then they will read (or listen) to it multiple times and as they get older will come to understand the harder bits.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that the ending dragged on; there was a long unnecessary journey to get back home, and they could have just glossed over that journey in a paragraph or two. I heartily recommend trying this book out on your kids.<br/><br/>One side note. It may bother some people that it’s not explained how Chloe exists as a sentient cloud or how she can make her body firm if she’s made of vapor, but it is called out at one point and a “promise” made to the reader that we will explore the answer to that question in future books; it just isn’t what this book is exploring.<br/><br/>A NetGalley ARC was provided to me. I don't think that has materially changed my review.",,,1,0

The New Weird genre is a reboot of the Weird Fiction genre of which HP Lovecraft is the most popular specimen.

Ok, that doesn’t sound like much of a “premise”…<br/><br/>And that alone feels bold; everything about this feels bold and intentionally weird, like the author is saying: come with me, and I will bring you on a fever dreamish descent into madness where we see just how deep the rabbit-hole goes, my friend. To top it all off, the small press publisher, Doom Fiction, says its mission statement is to destroy the world through infecting minds by using weapons constructed only of paper and carefully placed words. I love that! The author’s bio reads: “William Paley does not exist.” <br/><br/>I immediately had a feeling this was the kind of guy who has a weird sense of humor that I (and few others) love. I checked him out on Substack and then discovered him pulling off some awesome shenanigans…he posted about how he had this dream last night that his Christmas tree ate his dog. This garnered some responses, to which he also responded, and in the comments, more macabre details came out of his horrific dog eating tree dream. He ended with something along the lines of, “I’m thinking about cutting it up into a million pieces and burning it. The tree, that is, not the dog.”<br/><br/>So I had to read this book. <br/><br/>And in many ways it did not disappoint. He has a way of describing things that gives you that growing sense of horror as more is gradually revealed. He also writes in a surreal style that reminds me of a dream. The characters sometimes can't believe it themselves and keep trying to either wake up or stop hallucinating, but no, unfortunately, it appears that they cannot escape from their experience.<br/><br/>Themes: dreaming, body horror, losing sanity, lucid dreams dripping with portents, and isolation. There are also sometimes Biblical undertones. Overall there is a sense of simultaneous wonder and horror at discovering monsters and/or locations that are terrifying and overwhelming to any mortal human. That's one of the things horror can do best: confronting us with the knowledge of our own mortality.<br/><br/>There is one story also that has a character with a hypersexual mindset. It's less explicit and more just disturbing. Disturbing is, really, the word for most of these stories. These stories are for if you want to fall down the rabbit hole with someone losing their sanity. The story I just referred to actually has probably the most compelling character in the whole book though, even though she isn't exactly a good person; she's negligent of her child and obsessive; she's an addict, and I can relate to her mindset because I have addictions too, and I understand that addiction brings us down to terrible levels much lower than who we were created to be. She's addicted to using her phone to try to hook up with guys, essentially. You get all of the misgivings, the back-and-forth, the self doubt, the rationalizations, all of that that makes humans in distress so nuanced. She's very human, although I do wonder if she is truly representative of the female mindset, I do feel that it represents the addictive mindset very well, although I don't know that the author ever uses the word ""addict.""<br/><br/>The first and last stories are not so much astronaut stories; they are both squarely inside Tower Block 8, a location filled with terrors. Both of those stories involve mysteries being revealed surrounding the Captain and the Bedlam Bible and feel like they tie more into the whole of the overarching story of othe the Bedlam Bible series. As for the other stories in between, these were more actually about astronauts, but it's less clear how some of them connect. One of them is very apocalyptic. I will say, I don't think that by the end of the book I had learned very much definitive information about the overarching story. But I don't think that's mainly what the author was trying to do.<br/><br/>How do I rate this book? The story about the addict made it worth reading for me. The other stories had their moments but ultimately I wasn't sure what to make of them. There's an interesting Hell story, and an interesting Church of Death on the Moon which was interesting but random. Normally I dock points from stories that feel like they have elements that are too random, but I also feel like that's kind of the point of this genre (I'm intuiting that)...it's like a bad dream. When the next striking thing happens, it's not logical, but it may be evocative and have great symbolic meaning...ultimately it gets hard to fully deeply enjoy, though, if you're never really sure what the symbols represent. I guess I didn't have enough to work with to make these stories feel truly ""Great"" to me; some of them remained feeling a bit random. One of them, about ""negative waves,"" was not horrific.<br/><br/>So this collection wasn't perfect. Still somehow glad I read it; there were several very memorable, visceral, striking moments. The book is what it is. Ratings are all subjective made-up constructs anyways; I should just pick a rating and move on. I think I’ll round up because of how original the stories are.<br/><br/>I'm curious to read more by this author.",,,1,0

It’s an afrofuturist magical realism story set in Ghana; lots in here about shea butter and the matriarchal society really shines through as well; enjoyed the light touch on giving a slice of the culture.<br/><br/>This is a coming of age story about a young girl who suddenly has the power of death which, at the onset, is completely subconscious; it flares up as her body’s reaction to feeling threatened. Towards the beginning of the story her power kills everyone in her town including her mother and father and sibling. From then onward she roams the land from place to place and people give her anything she wants, both fearing and pitying her. Sometimes hating her. Sometimes loving her, when she eases the passing of people who are greatly suffering. Oh and a mysterious fox follows her around. Oh and whenever she touches technology (cars, robots, whatever) it ceases to function.<br/><br/>All of that is basically the setting and initial premise, the setup for the story. What is the story? Well, it’s a bit complicated. It feels like the coming of age story often but that’s not the only main part. There’s an evil corporation doing evil things, but that’s just really in the background. There’s a significant amount of story around how tech affects culture and vice versa. But I’d say the main story might be more about how one relates to oneself, especially the parts of oneself that are really hard to live with. <br/><br/>Yes, that’s a very important part of it. Perhaps the central thread. But certainly just one of many important threads. This book is more like a tapestry than a subway diagram. Which I like. That brings me to another thing I noticed, informed by my studies of cross-cultural communication. There’s a big difference between African storytelling and Western story telling. Western story telling is more about cause and effect, a focused linear plot; it’s more obvious what the plot is. Non Western cultures tend to think more holistically, like a tapestry. My thought is…this story is a really good blend of the two. It’s very cultural, it feels like the author is probably familiar with Ghana (a lot of nuances of a different culture come through), and yet it’s written so that Westerners can sink their teeth into it too.<br/><br/>If you’re looking to broaden your horizons into non Western literature this would be a great place to start.",,,1,0

The two collections couldn't have settings that are more different...Saunders' stories have modern settings and sometimes mix in mysterious science fiction, and he has a fetish for bizarre amusement parks. O'Connor, on the other hand, wrote gothic (creepy, horror-esque) stories about Southern people in the 50s.<br/><br/>And yet they both do the same thing really well, which I love: deep characterization. They both dance between the line of stream-of-consciousness and not. There are lots of inner thoughts, but blessedly, they are significantly more comprehensible than, say, Virginia Woolf or William Faulkner, the true stream-of-consciousness writers who throw you into a brain storm of thoughts devoid of context. Those feel like too much work for me to completely enjoy, although I respect them.<br/><br/>Saunders is my favorite living author. His combination of wit, weird humor, strange themes, and just...I don't know how to explain it, but he really knows how to write a short story. They are always very evocative and stick with me, and yet he never really gives you a solid definite moral to the story or even a definite theme.<br/><br/>I still don't know what themes Saunders was trying to get across to me and actually, I think that's a good thing, because that way it doesn't get in the way of the art, and allows me to read my own themes into it. I don't know what themes he had in mind not because he didn't have themes in mind, but because he writes in such a way that the stories and art come first, and he kind of gets himself ""out of the way"" of the story.<br/><br/>His prose is beautiful and stark at the same time. He does things that frankly I have no idea how he pulls off. His stories have darker elements and yet there is an element of hope that keeps them from just being purely bleak. In one particular story, I was struck with the fact that somehow, I felt quite hopeful at the end even though it ends with the protagonist dying. How did he do that?<br/><br/>This is one of the few books I have read multiple times. It has inspired me to read some of his other fiction: Lincoln in the Bardo and Liberation Day. Unfortunately, neither of those hit the high bar that Tenth of December hit for me; but you can read my reviews of those if you're curious for more detail.<br/><br/>One of his stories, Sticks, is only a page long. And it's one of the best flash fiction stories I have ever read; it has to do with the different ways that a group of adult sibilings react to the death of their father. There is a particular line I think about a lot, when he says that his father's ""one concession to glee"" was this pole that he would decorate with some ridiculous arnamentation, some kind of human-esque parody to represent the current season.<br/><br/>Anyways, this book is so full of paradoxical strengths. And he manages to write about so many different people in different stages and walks of life and be totally convincing. The first story, Victory Lap, has a teenage girl voice that for once is believable and yet not tropey. Without going into all of the stories I will just say, this book is a great character study and not a page is wasted.",,,2,0

That's me right now.<br/><br/>First: what’s good about this book? It’s a book expounding on lessons about how to pursue a vision, based on studying the book of Nehemiah from the Bible. <br/><br/>As bizarre as that sounds, I don’t think his extracted truths from the story were too far-fetched, most of the time. I do think his approach alienates any non Christians reading the book, but if he’s decided his target audience is just Christians, so be it.<br/><br/>He does a good job of covering the topic comprehensively and laying his chapters out to take you through the different stages of being a vision-casting leader, from having the vision through to leading a movement/organization, through to sustaining it. <br/><br/>He also does a good job of giving lots of examples from his real life that are visceral and striking. I learned a lot from this book.<br/><br/>And before I get to my objections, one more thing I’m grateful for, which is just that he is addressing one of the most important hidden truths in life in my opinion, which is that all of the big world changing things, anything of import, is driven by the few organizations (whether nonprofits, political organizations , businesses, grass roots movements, whatever) that have clear vision. <br/><br/>I came to this conclusion after reading Start With Why, a book that prompted me to look over all of the examples I could think of and see if they fit this paradigm.<br/><br/>Why is vision so important?<br/><br/>A company that has no vision right now: Star Wars as run by Disney. They have no vision for where they're going over the next several years; they're just throwing stuff against the wall at this point.<br/><br/>All great companies, organizations, and leaders have a solid vision that motivates people to move toward that point: a vision that is specific enough to be risky, and one that for various reasons motivates themselves and others, that connects to a firey passion that will push people way further than just motivating with money or negative consequences.<br/><br/>If you want to learn more about how to tell the difference between an organization with vision and one without it and why this is so freaking important (because it is!) I really recommend reading Start with Why. I think it’s one of the most important nonfiction books of all time; and it doesn't just apply to one industry or just to business; it's a way of looking at life as a whole. What causes should I give myself to? Seriously. Read that book.<br/><br/>But anyways, back to this book. The principle: vision is powerful, motivating, etc. Now the question is, how do I know if I'm onto something? I have a vision idea...now what?<br/><br/>This book's answer? Sit on it. Do nothing. Just think and pray and plan.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a bold stance and say: I think that is some of the worst advice you could possibly give.<br/><br/>But first, let's explore why Stanley advocates for his stance. Let's give his argument a fair shake.<br/><br/>His prime suggestion in this book: when you have a vision, you should basically sit and think a lot, take no action. The reasons? <br/>1) you aren't ready yet, <br/>2) visions are always susceptible (inherently) to criticism, and people will criticize it to death, and<br/>3) you need to be really sure before committing your time.<br/><br/>I'm going to contradict. I think people actually overthink vision too much. The surest way to fail at making something new is to take no action. As a software engineer, I have built many things over the last 12 years, and recently, one of them was my own vision that I promoted inside of a company where I was given a lot of latitude. <br/><br/>So I've learned a lot about startup thinking and product design from books and then applied it to developing real products. I've applied it outside work as well, and I think I've learned a couple of things about developing anything new, not just software.<br/><br/>In my experience, the only way you really know if something is a good vision/idea or not is to test it out in minature form and get feedback from reality (your ""customers,"" or the people who it is intended to impact); action is the only way you know for sure if this is the right thing to focus on above all others. Your experiment may reveal problems you weren't aware of. But even if the first experiment, even if the first 10 experiments ""fail"", they will also help you find out if this really matters to you. Do I really care about this vision? Do I care about it so much that I should set aside all else to focus on it for several years of my life, maybe my whole life? The answer will come to you, in my experience, if you start down the path. Even if the first 10 experiments fail, if this vision really is burning in your heart, then each failed experiment will only solidify in your heart even more that this is the thing you really care about and no matter how much you fail you can't give up on it.<br/><br/>Now I want to address Andy Stanley's three reasons for waiting and taking no action. His first reason: ""you aren't ready yet."" Ok first of all, you will never be ready. Second, the only way to get ready is to build experience...by...taking...action. Everything else you ""learn"" in your head is not real. You haven't learned anything until you take risk and try something. Only then can you refine your vision.<br/><br/>Andy's second reason: visions are inherently susceptible to criticism; once you ""go public"" lots of people will criticize it. My answer: if you can't develop thick skin then you will never do anything hard in your life, which is another way of saying you will never do anything meaningful in your life. If you don't have thick skin, do whatever it takes to develop it. Hint: partly, the only way you can develop it is by actually doing things and experiencing rejection and criticism.<br/><br/>And that's not meant to minimize how much it sucks to be rejected. I hate it too. But the reality is, no matter how much you ""prepare"" (and again none of that preparation is real if you're not taking action), none of that will make you immune to criticism. You have to ""go public"" and solicit other people's help to get anything meaningful done, even personal goals a lot of times. You've got to get over yourself.<br/><br/>Andy's third reason: you need to be really sure before committing your time. My answer: the same, the only way to minimize risk of doing the wrong thing is by testing things out in smaller form.<br/><br/>I've worked at places where we had no contact with customers. Or one place, even worse, where we pretended to...but all that happened was that once a year our product manager had a conference with one segment of our users, and those were basically super-users at that. Once a year! And then whatever ideas she had, those were considered gold, she was now the ""user expert""...ugh.<br/><br/>Product discovery is the process of discovering what has value to users (or customers or fans or whoever is on the other end of the thing you want to do). What problems do they have? A little broader, what opportunities do they have (which encompasses desires and wants and needs, not just ""problems"")?  How much does it matter to them to solve that problem? Are they already sacrificing time and money on workarounds? Etc. If you are totally new to this space, I would recommend reading The Mom Test first.<br/><br/>Actually, I would first recommend learning why companies fail who don't do enough customer discovery. And then once you know wy discovery is so important, then I would read the Mom Test because it will explain to you how to avoid the biggest pitfalls in discovery, why most people will lie to you, and what to do about it.<br/><br/>After that, I would recommend reading Zero to One by Thiel if you're creating a totally new thing, or Continuous Discovery Habits by Torres if you are iterating on an existing thing.<br/><br/>Okay, now that all the book recommendations are out of the way. What did I think of this Visioneering book overall?<br/><br/>There were good points in it. It was ain interesting layout; basically he studied the story of Nehemiah from scripture to extract principles from, which to me made it more interesting. He has lots of insights on vision. However at the end of the day, does the book do more good than harm? 50/50. I can't predict that, but I can say, I feel like I've seen it do a lot of harm in the company I'm a part of. If I was trying to set someone on what I think is most likely (in my humble opinion) the best path, I would not recommend this book.<br/><br/>My view of nonfiction is highly practical. If it doesn't do a net goot o people then how can I give it a high star rating? Nevertheless there are good things in it; you could have a net positive experience. There are a lot of good things about it. Hence my rating.",,,1,0

Big companies ignore smaller segments to their detriment; the company that focuses on a niche market and does really well with them will then expand outward to the more generic market and kill the competition. Big companies want to move on markets that already exist but you can’t know anything about a market that doesn’t exist yet.<br/>2. Disruptive markets are the ones where first mover’s advantage matters the most <br/>3. There is no market data, there is no hard numbers, there's none of that when you're dealing with a new emerging market <br/>4. Discovery-based planning: this is when you assume the market forecasts are wrong, not right <br/>5. As the products in a new market evolve, the customers’ main desires that drive their purchasing decisions go from functionality to reliability to convenience to price. Once you’re competing based on price you are making low margins and can only win through economies of scale and things like that.<br/>6. Almost all large companies are terrible places to do discovery of new projects; it will always be an uphill battle of people asking why that project needs to exist at all because it’s such a small portion of the pie, it doesn’t match with a large company’s growth needs. <br/>7. Normally the only times a large company fosters a new innovative product successfully is when the CEO himself (or someone nearly as important) makes it their personal vision and mission to make it happen at all costs, and even then it’s just a one time deal. Like Steve Jobs pushing Apple to make the iPhone even though it cannabalized iPod.<br/>8. Johnson and Johnson is an interesting case study, the exception to the rule. It manages 160 completely autonomous companies <br/><br/>There’s good stuff in here. But some of the advice is old news, the case studies are ancient history, and it’s also written clearly for a target audience of middle managers at big stuffy corporations that don’t understand how innovation works in the least. You know, the kind of companies that are dinosaurs; huge but ultimately irrelevant because they probably won’t be around twenty years from now. Finally, the tone was too corporate to be engaging. <br/><br/>I’m still begrudgingly glad I read this and at least it had the blessed strength of not being as overly long as most nonfiction is.",,,1,0

This book is where that idea comes from: that for any deep friendship, there is a language that only the two of you speak and no one else can replace it. This is explored through several different character relationships with the same man: John Singer.<br/><br/>Singer is a deaf mute. Ironically, a cast of very disparate characters all feel that Singer is the one man who really understands them. These people have different ages and genders and socioeconomic backgrounds and races and religious or economic perspectives, they are all outcasts from society in their own way. When they visit Singer at the same time, they fall into awkward silence, as they have absolutely nothing in common with each other (except for their friendship with Singer). And so they visit him individually instead.<br/><br/>How can all these people feel that Singer is the one person in the world who truly understands them? It’s a bit mysterious but perhaps part of it is that Singer is such a good listener. And there’s an interesting effect at play that if a canvas is blank, we read ourselves into it. Because Singer never says anything, he never shatters that illusion.<br/><br/>That would be one interpretation. The other is that perhaps he does understand them all very well precisely because he focuses intently on them to the exclusion of all else, without inserting himself into the conversation. Or perhaps it’s certain personality traits that he has, such as hospitality, focus, deep empathy, deep understanding. Or a combination of things. <br/><br/>And perhaps me trying to dissect the “how” of it detracts instead of adds. The fact is that there is something intangible to relationships. Something which defies description. With certain people you just “know” that they “get it.” And there’s something intangible to art, as well, and me trying to describe what this book does falls short because it defies description. True art is ineffable.<br/><br/>Needless to say, because of the strong connection that this book’s concepts has with my own grieving process over losing my father, I have a strong visceral connection with this book. It has caused me to reflect and helped me process the vicissitudes of life on par with what a deep philosophical book does to you, and yet this book is pure narrative, no polemic morals here. I highly recommend it to most people, unless you’re one of those who needs a fast plot to stay engaged. <br/><br/>The characters are some of the most distinctive, and I still have a very strong feeling for all of their personalities that has stuck with me even though it’s now been a few months since I read it. This is a book I look forward to returning to time and again through the years.",,,1,1

The idea is the Flow, a network of faster-than-light pathways through space that facilitate intergalactic trade. All of the pathways converge on an world called Hub, and one of them ends at a world called End. From End, you go back to Hub, the beginning. You see, the Flow has pathways that only go in one direction. And so, it takes a long time to get from Hub to End, but a very short period to get from End to Hub.<br/><br/>This concept is then applied to economics and politics and cultures and religion and more, and the results are just awesome.<br/><br/>But you learn all that gradually while hurtling through action and adventure. So yes, it's a good book, just for the sheer fact that he so masterfully interweaves awesome worldbuilding stuff with fast plot.<br/><br/>The main thing that keeps it from being a perfect read for me is that most of the characters feel like caricatures.

I was enjoying the view of southern life from a slightly alien perspective. The pronunciation of Southern slang was spot on in the audiobook version which I was listening to.   The setting was quaint, and the paternal figures and even minor characters were memorable and likable. I was having a good time as the story began.<br/><br/>Then it ended. What? I checked and double checked. There were the credits right there after these 4 chapters. No story had happened yet. I would really describe these first four chapters as a backstory that covers the early years of the main character’s life before getting to the main actual story, where Stuff Happens. But no. <br/><br/>This audiobook is 1 hr long, so maybe 8,000 words or so. It would have felt more accurate to call it a short story.<br/><br/>More to the point there needed to be more of a clear rising and falling action with resolution (plot) in order to feel like a cohesive complete story. I guess this could be called a coming of age story. There is one transformative event that happens toward the end. But there just isn’t enough conflict or rising tension.<br/><br/>But here’s the thing: I was thoroughly enjoying myself before it ended.

As soon as I heard that, I knew I had to read a book with a premise that whacky. That and, it’s by Tchaikovsky, whose misery-fest-of-a-book Cage of Souls was absolutely delightful in a way that only tortured souls like myself can understand. And who has the zoology chops to pull off a book like this, to help you actually get into the perspective of totally other life forms.<br/><br/>So anyways: yes: spiders. I know. But listen, really. He really masterfully thought through what a civilization would be like, its different levels as it advances through the ages, and how they would communicate differently, think differently, and form different gender roles and different hierarchies in their society because of their underlying biology and evolution. Masterful is the only word for it.<br/><br/>And I found myself actually caring about these (believe it or not!) spider characters. And you just might too.<br/><br/>There are also some interesting plot things going on with the humans, who are seriously messed up in the head, I have to say. Different megalomaniacs and brilliant people starved of sunlight and anything good and natural for generations on these worldships, and their society descending into barbarism…and a few of their leaders making themselves live forever with cryosleep…developing a mythos and cult around them…wow. Quite interesting. Merging organic consciousness with artificial intelligence…really great stuff in here.<br/><br/>Please don’t let the spiders turn you off. Give it a try, honestly, because Adrian Tchaikovsky is in my opinion one of the most brilliant worldbuilding minds in science fiction out there today. He’s an global treasure, an expert in zoology, and he will teach you way more about animals and evolution than you’ll learn in any other science fiction book. Same can be said for Cage of Souls, which also had some interesting ideas about evolution. Tchaikovsky is a seriously underrated author. For my taste at least.<br/><br/>I should mention that I think his characters are perhaps not for everyone. They are frequently miserable souls, bewildered, uncertain, tortured, surrounded by sociopaths and narcissists and various other assorted chocolates insane people on all sides…the protagonists’ nobility lies in them being relatively normal and not being terrible people compared to those around them. They’re just trying to survive, mostly. But they’re also intelligent. Thank God for protagonists that don’t advance the plot through being morons! Thank you. So yes, his protagonists really work for me.<br/><br/>I don’t know how it is that I never managed to give this a review at the time that I read it a few months ago! Funny how that works sometimes: when I’m blazing through a book to get to the finish line because it’s so good, then after I get there, I take a break from thinking about it. But then later in following weeks, it comes back for me to think about.<br/><br/>For this book, it’s the spiders I think about a lot, all the challenges they overcome (it’s really like their civilization itself is a hero that you want to triumph). And I think particularly about their interesting cities, which are basically skyscrapers built on massive trees, with huge vast webs connecting them. Their tech tree evolves so much differently than ours; they never invented the wheel but they got to radios and lasers way faster than we did.<br/><br/>I really can’t wait to read the rest of this series. There’s the fate of the human race hanging in the balance. This isn’t much of a spoiler really, more like just the premise of the whole dang trilogy, but basically the humans have run out of options and the one planet that’s looking good and inhabitable is also the one with the giant spider civilization. Spoilers ahead but: in the first book they have a brief encounter; basically it’s a horror scene for the humans. It’s great. In the second book it looks like there’s going to be a lot more interaction between the two civilizations and I can’t wait to see what happens. And/or explore other planets/colonies as well, not sure if that’s coming.<br/><br/>Just read the book.",,,1,0

When all goes well<br/>a shadow will overthrow it. If it be unkind<br/>one stroke of a wet sponge wipes all the picture out;<br/>and that is far the most unhappy thing of all.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 1327-1330<br/><br/>Aeschylus is considered the master of lyrical tragedy; his language is much more poetic than Sophocles and therefore much harder to read in translation. I found occasionally wondering “what the hell exactly am I reading?” but for the most part I was able to track with it.<br/><br/>I've been really impressed by these translations by Lattimore which capture a lot of the poetry, which is really hard to do in translation. It’s truly very beautiful.<br/><br/>The plot is very sparse in each of these plays. These were written in the early days of the development of Greek tragedic plays, so it’s almost a set of lyrics that are inspired by a particular event from the popular stories of their mythology.  Musicals are the closest modern thing we have to the lyric dramas of ancient Greece. There is a plot, to be sure. There is a series of events with multiple actors and a rise in tension culminating in a climax, to be sure, but these usually only have two actors at a time (not counting the chorus), are typically only one scene at one setting, and any action happens offscreen. You’re not reading it for the plot; you’re reading it for the poetry.<br/><br/>This particular book of Aeschylus is the Oresteia, a trilogy, each play about 60 pages long. It is special for being the only surviving complete trilogy we have by Aeschylus, who is the earliest of the great three Greek tragedians (Euripides and Sophocles being the others). So, loving the ancients as I do, I was eager to get into it.<br/><br/>The plot<br/><br/>The first two plays, Agamemnon and The Libation Bearers, are soap operas about family members killing each other. The third, the Euripides, is a court room battle between gods, based on the subject matter of the first two plays, to decide whether Orestes is justified in killing his mother in revenge for her having killed his father, the king of the city (Thebes).<br/><br/>So the whole trilogy is about the family of Atreus, which is truly, deeply, disturbed. <br/><br/>If you recall your boy Agamemnon, from the Trojan War, the guy who headed up all the Greek armies to take back his brother's wife Helen? That guy comes home. Turns out, before he went on the Trojan War killing spree, he made a sacrifice to the gods to ensure victory. He made a sacrifice of........one of his daughters. Turns out, his wife was unhappy about this.<br/><br/>Despite the clear motivation, his wife is easily the least sympathetic character in any of the plays. She’s been sleeping with her husband’s rival and plotting to kill old Ag when he comes back. She also reads a bit like a narcissist, unable to have basic empathy for others.<br/><br/>Granted, she has been through some hard things in life. One of her daughters was killed by her husband. Also, her name is Clytemnestra. Yikes.<br/><br/>For his part, Agamemnon has some beatiful passages that seem to foreshadow his end.<br/><br/>“From the gods who sit in grandeur<br/>grace comes somehow violent.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 182<br/><br/>“Justice so moves that those only learn<br/>who suffer; and the future<br/>you shall know when it has come; before then, forget it.<br/>It is grief too soon given.<br/>All will come clear in the next dawn’s sunlight.<br/>Let good fortune follow these things as<br/>she who is here desires,<br/>our Apian land’s singlehearted protectress.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 250-257<br/><br/>When Agamemnon comes back, ole Clyte is sweet as roses, lures him inside, surrounds him with robes to entangle him, and then stabs him to death. It’s really chilling stuff. And then she and his brother begin ruling, joyous to be doing so over his dead body. Nasty people.<br/><br/>“Chorus: Have your way, gorge and grow fat, soil justice, while the power is yours.<br/>Aegisthus: You shall pay, make no mistake, for this misguided insolence.<br/>Chorus: Crow and strut, brave cockerel by your hen; you have no threats to fear.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 1668-1671<br/><br/>So that’s the first play. It sets you up really well to hate Clyte and her lover, and the second play, the Libation Bearers, is satisfying because you see these awful people get theirs.<br/> <br/>How do they get theirs? Well, Ag and Clyte had two other children, besides the sacrificed one. They had a daughter, Electra, who is mega pissed about the whole killing-my-dad thing. Her brother, Orestes, is in exile for many years, growing up to be a man. Then he comes back in disguise, kills his mother and her lover, and becomes the new rightful ruler of Thebes.<br/><br/>In short, it's a play all about grief, about the catharsis of revenge...or justice, depending on how you look at it (more on that later).<br/><br/>Grief:<br/>“My cheek shows bright, ripped in the bloody furrows<br/>of nails gashing the skin.<br/>This is my life: to feed the heart on hard-drawn breath.<br/>And in my grief, with splitting weft<br/>of ragtorn linen across my heart’s<br/>brave show of robes<br/>came sound of my hands’ strokes<br/>in sorrows whence smiles are fled.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 24-31<br/><br/>Justice:<br/>“The day of destiny waits for the free man as well<br/>as for the man enslaved beneath an alien hand.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 103-104<br/><br/>Bitter irony:<br/>“You love your man, then? You shall lie in the same grave<br/>with him, and never be unfaithful even in death.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 894-895<br/><br/>A foreshadowing of dark things to come for Orestes, for one cannot kill his mother and have no repercussions:<br/>“Take care. Your mother’s curse, like dogs, will drag you down.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 924<br/><br/>“I would have you know, I see not how this thing will end.<br/>I am a charioteer whose course is wrenched outside <br/>the track, for I am beaten, my rebellious senses<br/>bolt with my headlong and the fear against my heart<br/>is ready for the singing and dance of wrath.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 1021-1025<br/><br/>It’s a bit disturbing how easily he kills his mother but the big picture is, by this point you’re happy to see them both dead. Awesome, they both deserved it, we’re good, everyone's happy.<br/> <br/>NOT. <br/> <br/>In the final play (titled Euripedes, the fancy name for the Furies), it turns out the Furies are NOT happy about anyone who kills their mother, no matter how justified you think you are. The blood cries out.<br/><br/>The Furies come for your boy Orestes, they want him to pay blood for blood. Orestes says hey, the god Apollo told me it was ok! So, Athena is called on to adjudicate a court case with plaintiff Apollo on the left and plaintiff the Furies on the right.<br/><br/>The Theme of “the Euripides”<br/> <br/>It's a rather interesting play because the Furies represent the old gods of Greece (barbaric, primeval, primal, unreasoning) and Apollo represents the new gods (reasonable, thinking, intelligent) and Athena is wisdom, who tries to marry the two and appease them. The play represents Ancient Greece wrestling with its own identity as it develops into democratized, (semi-)civilized city-states.<br/> <br/>So when Athena rules in Apollo's favor and Orestes gets off the hook, the endless chain of revenge killings finally ends.<br/><br/>“I will speak in defence<br/>of reason: for the very child<br/>of vanity is violence;<br/>but out of health<br/>in the heart issues the beloved<br/>and the longed-for, prosperity.”<br/> - The Eumenides, 532-537 (emphasis mine)<br/><br/>It represents progression from the old justice to a new more civilized one: from Lex Talionis (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth) to something adjudicated by higher powers using reason to dictate justice and settle disputes in a way that finally stops the endless revenge killing that defined the old ways.<br/><br/>I think this is a powerful theme when you consider the historical significance of the justice system. Think about it: before then, the whole government of any people was just a single person: a king, or tyrant. This single person was executive, judicial, and legislative all at once. And he was not elected, but rather determined by the latest struggle of wills, the outcome of armed conflict. So, when Orestes kills his mother and her lover (the king and queen) he is actually just operating according to the established order of things; that is how corrupt leaders are deposed in their world.<br/><br/>He also is reclaiming his rightful throne, which simultaneously grants him the right to dispense justice…which is what he’s just done by killing them. If you kill the current king, you’re the new king. If you’re the new king, then you can dispense justice as you see fit. <br/><br/>The hope in that system is that sometimes you get a king who is noble and just. But what happens when the king has a conflict of interest? In this play, Orestes has a huge conflict of interest: one of the people who needs to be removed is his own mother, and the murder in question was against his own father.<br/><br/>And there is a natural law at play (which the Furies represent), which is that it is perverse and disturbing to kill your own family. (Actually we believe today that it’s rather perverse to kill anyone, but they hadn’t yet arrived to this point in their ethics.)<br/><br/>Loyalty to Family vs The State<br/><br/>This play is one part of a wider theme in Greek literature. There was a belief in the State that was very strong. Socrates made a career of being “the gadfly that stings Athens into action,” even while knowing that this would eventually cost him his life, because he believed that the good of the State came above his own. He refuses an offer to flee the night before his execution for the same reason: who am I to question the will of the state, which has made me who I am?<br/><br/>And then when it comes to Plato, he states plainly in the Republic that the State should have precedence over the family.<br/><br/>This idea is hard for me, someone heavily disillusioned with the fake democracy of America that we have today. <br/><br/>But if I stop and think about their context, about what governments they had to compare against, how they were pushing against the sheer darkness surrounding them on all sides of barbarism and endless war and strife…then yes. I could see how I could give myself over to the cause. I can see how I might die for an idea like that.<br/><br/>Summary of Overall Impressions<br/> <br/>I’ve gone widely astray from focusing on the plays themselves, but this in and of itself speaks to the power of the themes in the Oresteia, the fact that it can inspire so much more thought. My measure of a good book is that it makes me think afterward, and Aeschylus has made me do that. And for that I am grateful.<br/><br/>So that's a summary. But I will spend the rest of this review diving deeper into the Furies and into sharing excerpts of the beautiful poetry in this play.<br/><br/>A Deeper Dive into the Furies<br/><br/>Note that Athena admits her perspective (partiality?) as a judge. Because she was born differently than most, she will not be moved unduly by the case having to do with a mother being killed: she was not born of a woman like others, but rather, if you recall your mythology, sprung straight from the brain of Zeus. I think this is not an accidental side-note, but rather, a very deliberate choice. In the Greek mythos, wisdom is birthed not from a woman, but from the brain (intellect, thinking, reason) of a man. There is a sexist undertone here, and it is not unwarranted—the ancient Greek thought was heavily misogynistic (and I say that from considerable evidence, having read a fair amount of Plato, Homer, Sophocles, and Aeschlyus, as well as researched the topic at great length). But I do find it interesting that Athena herself is feminine.<br/><br/>Regardless, if we set aside the possible sexist undertones, I think there is possibly something of depth and interest to this idea of Athena being the judge. At first I was mystified by the idea that the judge would be partial, but as I started to think about it, her unique qualifications makes her not so much partial, but rather, the only possible impartial person. We all know how hard it is to be objective about one’s mother—being loyal to one’s mother is one of the most deeply ingrained instincts. So actually, similarly to how in a modern court, jurors are screened to ensure that no jury member is predisposed regarding the case, here all others but Athena are disqualified, relatively speaking, to her.<br/><br/>This court case is about establishing the new, better system of justice, one that’s not based on feelings, not just reacting out of strong feelings, which is exactly what leads you to the endless revenge-killings that they had previously been stuck in. It represents moving beyond that to something higher: a justice based not on feelings but on reason.<br/><br/>The Blessing of the Furies<br/><br/>After the Furies lose the court case, and then Athena spends a lot of time trying to appease their fury. She ends up appealing to their mutual interest of the benefit of the people of Thebes, and convinces them to bless the land instead of curse it. Their blessing on the land is one of the most beautiful passages.<br/><br/>It's reminiscent to me of some passages in the Bible. It felt healing to me, like speaking a word of blessing to heal all the years of bloodshed in the past, saying: let things now begin to heal.<br/><br/>Outrage of the Furies at their Treatment<br/><br/>“Gods of the younger generation, you have ridden down<br/>the laws of the elder time, torn them out of my hands.<br/>I, disinherited, suffering, heavy with anger<br/>shall let loose on the land<br/>the vindictive poison<br/>dripping deadly out of my heart upon the ground;<br/>this form itself shall breed<br/>cancer, the leafless, the barren<br/>to strike, for the right, their low lands<br/>and drag its smear of mortal infection on the ground.<br/>What shall I do? Afflicted<br/>I am mocked by these people.<br/>I have borne what can not<br/>be borne. Great the sorrows and the dishonor upon<br/>the sad daughters of night.”<br/> - The Eumenides, 778-792<br/><br/>The Furies Blessing<br/><br/>“Let there blow no wind that wrecks the trees.<br/>I pronounce words of grace.<br/>Nor blaze of heat blind the blossoms of grown plants, nor<br/>cross the circles of its right<br/>place. Let no barren deadly sickness creep and kill.<br/>Flocks fatten. Earth be kind<br/>to them, with double fold of fruit<br/>in time appointed for its yielding. Secret child<br/>of earth, her hidden wealth, bestow<br/>blessing and surprise of gods.”<br/> - The Eumenides, 938-948<br/><br/>“Death of manhood cut down<br/>before its prime I forbid:<br/>girl’s grace and glory find<br/>men to live life with them.<br/>Grant, you who have the power.<br/>And o, steering spirits of law, <br/>goddesses of destiny,<br/>sisters from my mother, hear;<br/>in all house implicate,<br/>in all time heavy of hand<br/>on whom your just arrest befalls,<br/>august among goddesses, bestow.”<br/> - The Eumenides, 954-967<br/><br/>Further Quotes<br/><br/>If you're still reading this review, that's amazing! Finally, here are other quotes I found particularly striking.<br/><br/>“Zeus, who guided men to think,<br/>who has laid it down that wisdom<br/>comes alone through suffering.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 176<br/><br/>“Yet the good shepherd, who knows his flock,<br/>the eyes of men cannot lie to him,<br/>that with water of feigned<br/>love seem to smile from the true heart.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 795-798<br/><br/>“Yet it is true: the high strength of men<br/>knows no content with limitation. Sickness<br/>chambered beside it beats at the wall between.<br/>Man’s fate that sets a true<br/>course yet may strike upon<br/>the blind and sudden reefs of disaster.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 1001-1016<br/><br/>“No, but a house that God hates, guilty within<br/>of kindred blood shed, torture of its own,<br/>the shambles for men’s butchery, the dripping floor.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 1090-1092<br/><br/>“Yet once more will I speak, and not this time my own<br/>death’s threnody. I call upon the Sun in prayer <br/>against that ultimate shining when the avengers strike<br/>these monsters down in blood, that they avenge as well<br/>one simple slave who died, a small thing, lightly killed.”<br/> - Agamemnon, 1322-1326<br/><br/>""Let one come, in strength<br/>of spear, some man at arms who will set free the house<br/>holding the Scythian bow backbent in his hands,<br/>a barbarous god of war spattering arrows<br/>or closing to slash, with sword hilted fast to his hand.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 159-163<br/><br/>“The gods know, and we call upon the gods; they know<br/>how we are spun in circles like seafarers, in<br/>what storms. But if we are to win, and our ship live,<br/>from one small seed could burgeon an enormous tree.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 201-204<br/><br/>“So, though you died, you shall not yet be dead, for when<br/>a man dies, children are the voice of his salvation<br/>afterward. Like corks upon the net, these hold<br/>the drenched and flaxen meshes, and they will not drown.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 504-507<br/><br/>“Right’s anvil stands staunch on the ground<br/>and the smith, Destiny, hammers out the sword.”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 646-647<br/><br/>“Now where away, Cilissa, through the castle gates,<br/>with sorrow as your hireless fellow-wayfarer?”<br/> - The Libation Bearers, 731-732<br/>",,,1,0

These patterns have been played out the world over, again and again, in so many countries and political parties.<br/><br/>I used to think that between 1984 and Brave New World, that the later got things more right because a system built on drugging your population by appealing to their happiness (as opposed to their fear) is more self-sustaining. Today, I look at the long-lasting examples in the real world of both and think, it looks like either one can be self-sustaining.If anything, this story is sad and scary because certain places (China and North Korea for instance) are so ridiculously dystopian today that, well...I really wish this book were just fiction, because of all of the very real people who have to live in these regimes.<br/><br/>To the degree that a country or political party mimics the ones in this book is the degree to which they should not be taken seriously in one sense--in that they should have zero credibility--but they should be taken very seriously in another sense--in that they know what they are doing and are a serious threat to the free world.

It's very wide but not very tall, reminiscent of some of the comic books I read growing up. One of the benefits of this is that the pages actually stay open if you leave it open and move your hands elsewhere, say to type up notes.<br/><br/>The style is very intentionally low-key, informal. And that fits the content of the book. The reframing process is part art, part science. It's really a creative process rather than a rigid linear thing, although it gives you a linear set of things to try, different ways to reframe. The design of this book is so wise; it helps business-type, linear, direct people engage in non-linear, creative problem-solving. It works well for basically whoever you are though.<br/><br/>Not only is this book chock-full of practical advice, it also gives examples at every turn, so many examples, and each of them are evocative and really help to illustrate the principle. <br/><br/>It's also just a really important topic; I now see (not just from the examples but also from practicing these principles on several problems both at work and personal and in my marriage) that learning the art of reframing is one of the best skills to learn in life, period. No holds barred. Not only do you come up with vastly better types of solutions, but you also learn to empathize with and understand other people better and the world better as a whole.<br/><br/>And this process also is really masterful at managing the balance between action and thinking/reflecting.<br/><br/>To boot, it provides a whole series, at the end, of techniques for when your client/stakeholders/whoever are resisting the process.

As I read, I’ll talk about what I’m reading to my friends. I was mentioning Achilles’ death to my wife, and she said, “oh, that’s where the name Achilles’ Tendon comes from…”. Greek literature explains a lot of the idioms and names even that are baked into our language, as well as many of our tropes: I’ve heard speeches or sermons mention the myth of Sisyphus many times, still as relevant today as it was thousands of years ago. For those reasons alone, I am immensely grateful I read the Iliad.<br/><br/>I’m also grateful for the epic feeling it has, for the theme of the sad and brutal nature of war (is this the first book with the theme “war is hell”? not sure, but it’s certainly one of the most notable early works with this theme).<br/><br/>I also appreciate how, while the story is narrated from the perspective of the Greeks—it’s clear we are meant to want them to win over the Trojans—this does not mean that Homer portrays all the Greeks as ideal heroes and all of the Trojans as evil villains. In fact, great lengths are taken to show how much of an asshole Achilles is and how noble that Hector is. These two (each of which represent the best of each side—at least, the best militarily, in Achilles’ case) are oppositely aligned with how you would think. Achilles, the best warrior for the “good” side, is narcissistic, selfish, arrogant, and profane in how he treats the living and the dead. Hector, the best warrior for the “bad” Trojans, is a family man, is loved by all, is noble and just and temperate. When Achilles kills Hector (spoilers) you actually feel pretty sad; this isn’t just a patriotic “boo-yeah, take that” kind of book.<br/><br/>Since I don’t have the pleasure of knowing how to read Greek, I had to read this in translation (not ideal for something that’s poetry). So unfortunately I know that there’s a whole aspect to this that I completely missed out on.<br/><br/>Another word about the particular translation I read (the big gold book with the Iliad and the Odyssey together published by Fall River with the silhouette of a ship on the front cover). It’s not great. It is meant to be a more “natural” translation, which I’m fine and good with, rather than necessarily being as literal as some. That’s fine. What sucks is certain phrases are in this translation like “all big and bigly” and “all huge and hugely.” Yes I kid you not, those are in there. I’m guessing that they chose to translate it that way because that probably shows something about how it was worded in Greek….but certain things just don’t translate well. As a translator, there are certain things you just need to not do literally or it sounds awful and really distracts the reader.<br/><br/>The main detracting aspect of the Iliad, for me, was that it’s too long. You know how in Dragonball Z every episode started to feel the same? That’s how this book is from about the 40% mark to the 80% mark. It’s extremely repetitive. Another bunch of people die, and many of them are given a paragraph elegy of what they were known for in their life, usually closed by a remark about how all of their fill-in-the-blank (whether they had a lot of money or friends or whatever) couldn’t save them from death in the end. Repeat this five more times in a row. Then have the Greeks get pushed back a little further. Then have some hero spur people to greater action with their words. Then go back to listing a bunch of people dying, repeat ad nauseum. Again. And again. And again. Times fifty. It’s just too much; you could just skip over most of that and be none the worse; the plot isn’t progressing, we’re still just waiting for most of the book for Achilles to save the Greeks.<br/><br/>There is a huge host of heroes, especially on the Greek side. I like that. Diomed, Sarpedon, the two Ajaxes, Odysseus, Agamemnon, the Spartan dude Menelaus, Patroclus, Hector, Achilles. Each of these have their limelight moments and each one has certain things that they’re better at. That’s kind of co ol. A couple of important people actually die before the end. And Hector of course, the second most important person in the whole book. Most of this book is a list of Hector’s triumphs over the Greeks and constant allusion/foreshadowing that he will die in the end at Achilles hands and Achilles will die also. It’s stated so many times that it’s kind of interesting how different the Greeks viewed suspense in literature than we do.<br/><br/>The gods feature a lot. They are constantly fighting with each other in petty squabbles. For some reason they are intensely preoccupied with the fight of the Greeks vs the Trojans, like they have nothing better to do than watch this spectator sport and mess with it occasionally. It feels kind of random and whimsical, not really that helpful to the story from my perspective, but I’m sure for the Greeks reading in Homer’s time it was probably more meaningful. I don’t like how the gods just randomly whisk people away in a mist or do other abilities that apparently are universal to all gods and have nothing to do with their particular gifting.<br/><br/>A big part of what I experienced while reading the Iliad happened when reading the passages written about someone dying. Homer does tons of these. He will describe the spear piercing through their head just below the forehead, piercing all the way through their bones and brains and coming out the backside or something pretty graphic and detailed like that. Then he’ll talk about what this person was known for, how they had a lot of friends back home because they owned a tavern, or they were known for winning some battles against their neighbors, etc, and oftentimes there’s some comment about how none of their fill-in-the-blank could save them now from dying. I read these passages as a mixture of sadness and graphic brutality.<br/><br/>The meaning I read into these is: war is Hell, man is mortal, nothing you do in life can save you from your predestined end, no matter how impressive your life has been up until that point.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of the fatalism philosophy throughout other passages in the Iliad that inform my take on these death passages. By fatalism I mean the idea (which you often see in Greek philosophical works as well as their myths) that one’s death (and other major events in one’s life) have been predetermined by spiritual powers outside of our control, determined perhaps since long before we were even born.<br/><br/>This idea is no longer popular in Western culture, especially in America, we prefer the myth (literary usage of the term) that man can choose his own destiny. I think we can lose balance. Reality is that there are many huge powers in the world that are very much outside of our control, which should be evident to anyone regardless of your spiritual beliefs, and at some level we have to make peace with that reality in our lives. We don’t get to control when we die. We have some say in it, we can eat healthier and choose to not smoke, etc, but still, you could die of heart complications after giving birth to a child, as just happened to a friend of my wife’s the other day. It’s a very sad story and having to cope with things like that is a fundamental part of the human condition I think.<br/><br/>So I think the Iliad has value for speaking to that theme, although I hardly think it covers it very exhaustively.<br/><br/>My main complaint is just that it’s too repetitive.<br/><br/>I also wonder a lot about Homer’s intent. According to scholars, they think this was written a few hundred years after these events took place. But it’s written with a lot of details that make it feel pretty historical, all of these specific people with their backstories and so forth. It seems odd that Homer would make up all of these details wholecloth. I like to imagine that perhaps it was written during the time that these events happened, and he merely used these stories about the gods and these miraculous events in the battles as ways of explaining events that people witnessed that didn’t make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>War has lots of chaos in it, weird things happening all the time, and we need a way to make sense of these things that heavily impact us, like our best friend dying, or inexplicably losing a conflict that you thought you would win, or some enemy of ours seeming to just miraculously never get injured when your efforts would yield great results with anyone else. If I look at it this way, Homer’s story makes sense; if I side with the scholars it just doesn’t. So I choose to believe that Homer wrote about events that happened in his lifetime.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of beautiful turns of phrase and epic scenes and other passages that also made this worth reading. I’ve made an index of them for myself so that in the future I can refer to that instead of having to read the whole thing again. Because l’m lazy, there’s only so much time, and frankly it was a slog to read sometimes. But I’m still glad I read it. I honestly feel like it’s kind of overrated when compared to some other ancient literature that speak to more themes and transcend through time and space better. But, I'm reading it in translation and not getting the full affect of the poetry.<br/><br/>And also, it’s still quite the epic. Not one I always understand, but still, quite the epic undertaking, and done in prehistory, a precursor to so much else. Cheers, Homer, for all that you did and the way you paved to so much more in the world of literature that can all be passed back to you. Thank you so much for what you did. The world was changed because of you. ",,,1,0

This is how it’s scored in the assessment at the back of the book in case there was any question about exactly how strongly he’s saying this. Dude, he could not be more wrong about that. Working extra hours frequently is unhealthy for the individual as well as irresponsible, myopic, and just plain dumb in most cases. Why do I say that? There has actually been research that most people who are “workaholics” are NOT actually working while at work for vast portions of the time. Another study of Japan, the highest working-hours country on the planet, showed the same thing. Working extra hours = less productivity. Yeah it sounds counter intuitive but the science shows it. So not only are you tanking your personal life and everything that really matters in life (yeah family and personal goals and passion should matter more than your work even if you love your work! No duh!), but you’re also less productive at work. Essentially you’re wasting both parts of your life. Don’t do it! And don’t work at a place that expects you to work more than 40hrs regularly! Or a place that says we aren’t going to be that way but just for this one season we’ve been doing it for a few months…and yes well there have been other seasons…but this time is going to be different…RUN. I interviewed for a company like that recently and I’m so glad I dug in and asked targeted questions to determine the truth. <br/><br/>I used to overwork. One day I found myself standing in line next to a guy who was known at my company for being the go-to guy for whenever a project was behind, throw him on there and he will come through. I asked him what his secret was. He told me, no lie, his secret was that he almost never worked more than 40hrs. That was it. Literally. Changed my life.

These are stories that feel very authentic to real life, no moralism or Disney endings slapped on. They show a world that is full of vibrant life among darkness, a full world, sometimes quite dark, but even in those stories there is usually some kind of small victory against the darkness. And the prose is wonderful.<br/><br/>I didn’t realize when I bought this book that it was a collection of short stories, and because it’s written in first person and the narrators’ names are never disclosed, this became confusing, but after a while I figured out that these were short stories and the world made sense again.<br/><br/>Each story shows a handful of different characters so that by the end of the book you get a pretty good composite view of life in Thailand. There’s a lot of foreigners, too, showing different ways that Thais view others, including Americans, Cambodian refugees, and a Filipino cockfighter.<br/><br/>This author has first rate writing chops. He must have lived quite a while in the States, or else read a whole lot of English literature, because he uses words like thespian, recalcitrant, monomania, etc., and uses them correctly. So this book is a real gem for any English speaking person who wants to learn about Thai culture, because you have someone who knows Thai culture and is a first rate author in English.<br/><br/>Of course there is a bit of a downside there, because that means that his perspective is going to be a bit more American than the typical native Thai person’s.

It makes me want to go out and read the next 10 books in the series right now. (Not that I have that much time on my hands sadly!) Having watched the first four seasons of The Expanse before reading this, I knew some of what to expect. The two are pretty similar in tone,  characters, plotline, etc. One thing different was Miller is fleshed out more in the book and his story is has some more nuances and he has more crossover time with the crew of the Rocinante.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the thing I think the Expanse does best is show different characters in relationship with each other. That is just stellar. The characters are deep, you get a sense of full backstories, but the book isn't so slow-paced as to delve into those in detail or anything. For me the pacing is perfect. (I'm sure there are many for whom this would be too slow though.)<br/><br/>As far as the prose, there are some really good metaphors, but aside from that it's kind of standard stuff.<br/><br/>The worldbuilding is wonderful, perhaps the other thing that The Expanse does best. This is ""hard scifi,"" in the sense that they don't constantly violate the laws of physics. Ships actually fly the way ships would fly in space, inertia is conserved, the insane G-forces involved in manuevering in space wreck havoc on the human body and have to be compensated for in various ways, etc. This, I love. It's very interesting to me to think about how the world (I mean, solar system) might look in a couple hundred years. There are two specific things that are in the books that science doesn't know of a way to make possible currently, but that is kind of called out and safely quarantined. So you have just enough mysterious stuff to provoke a sense of wonder, but not a blatant disregard of the laws of physics. It feels much more realistic and immersive that way.<br/><br/>Why I rate this a 4* and not 5* I couldn't exactly say. I've spent some time pondering that, and at the end of the day I don't think it's anything that's objectively wrong with it; it just isn't in the style that I would prefer, the style that really makes me love something.

4982,The Sirens of Titan,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,"Jr., Kurt Vonnegut",Chris     Moore,"=""""","=""""",5,4.15,Gollancz,Paperback,224,1999,1959,2021/02/23,2021/02/09,,,read,"Kurt Vonnegut was hilarious, strange, and brilliant, as usual.<br/><br/>This book is kind of about <spoiler>a Martian invasion</spoiler>. And kind of about an extreme narcissist who exists now as a wave form (that starts at the Sun and terminates in Betelgeuse) and materializes periodically in different places. And kind of about the Space Wanderer, Malachi Constant, who travels about on Mercury and Mars and Earth and Titan. And kind of about prophecy. And it's kind of more about the idea that man shouldn't conflate luck with God/gods having favor/disfavor on him. There's a hilarious new religion invented to worship ""God of the Utterly Indifferent."" God doesn't care about you. That's the point of the religion. LOL.<br/><br/>Kurt is hilarious. Whether he's describing his bizarre religion, or explaining the epic swampiness of bureaucracy, or the painstaking process of an idiot trying to write down a list of everything he knows, a mnemonic song of the 21 months of Mars (in order to keep straight which ones have 30 or 31 days), or the design of the Martian attack spaceship:<br/><br/>""The only controls available to those onboard were two push-buttons on the center-post of the cabin--one labeled <i>on</i> and one labeled <i>off</i>. The <i>on</i> button simply started a flight from Mars. The <i>off</i> button was connected to nothing. It was installed at the insistence of Martian mental-health experts, who said that human beings were always happier with machinery they thought they could turn off.""<br/><br/>Oftentimes he masterfully blends insight and irony and/or absurdist humor.<br/><br/>""There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of everything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.""<br/><br/>""It has been said that Earthling civilization, so far, has created ten thousand wars, but only three intelligent commentaries on war--the commentaries of Thucydides, of Julius Ceasar and of Winston Niles Rumfoord.""<br/><br/>He also occasionally really packs an emotional punch. He masterfully tells a love story in two pages, 161-163, which moved me surprisingly deeply. It reads as powerfully as a myth. There's also a very poignant ending written for one of the characters in the middle of the book.<br/><br/>A favorite quote: ""All living things were brothers, and all dead things were even more so.""<br/><br/>KV has so many insights about the weird way humans are. For instance he describes on page 276 how humans are peculiar in that they behave at all times as if they were performing for an imaginary Big Eye--one ravenous for entertainment. He goes on to describe this in detail.<br/><br/>The main point of the book at the end is most likely--if it does have a point--that <spoiler>all the events we ascribe meaning to are not necessarily meaningful. They could be random, or even worse, they could be caused by the whimsy of some other beings who, far from gods, simply want something silly and self-centered and we're just incidentally ""in the way.""<br/><br/>He also goes on to point out that the worst atrocities in history were done by people who do things they think God wants done. Don't do anything you think God wants done. He doesn't need you. This was another big LOL for me; obviously such a religion wouldn't get many followers in real life. I think his aim is probably making fun of religion in general--or perhaps, making fun of how we humans think about and use religion.</spoiler><br/><br/>But you don't read Kurt Vonnegut to get ""a point."" You read him because he's hilarious in a very unique way, supremely witty, makes you think, and best of all, for me at least, I honestly can never tell when he's being ironic and when he's not because--here's my theory--he has this sense of humor that just mixes sincerity and irony together into one thing. He's both at the same time. It's my theory that he is doing this because he reminds me of me when I am doing that. Not that I'm saying I'm nearly as funny as Kurt. But it reminds me of me doing that.<br/><br/>Just to set expectations in case you've never heard of Vonnegut, this is not a standard novel with nice sympathetic characters whose only flaw is being clumsy and cute. His characters are all unlikable in this book, some of them kind of repulsive. But they are very human. And this isn't science fiction that's trying to be realistic--although a few things in it are kind of--but for the most part the science fiction is supposed to be absurd. Everything in the story--plot, science, characters, setting--are played with to make the book more entertaining, humorous, and insightful. That's how Vonnegut writes.<br/><br/>Anyways...read this. If you've never read Kurt Vonnegut, just grab one of his books. They're all really short and once you read one you'll probably know if you love him or hate him. It won't cost you much. And if you discover you love him, you will have gotten a whole lot out of him. If you were going to read one book I probably wouldn't start with this; I think Slaughterhouse Five is even better. But this is an excellent book as well. It's the first major one he got published I believe.<br/><br/>If you have read Slaughterhouse Five already, a good benefit of reading Sirens of Titan is that it explores the origins of the Trafalmadores, which is quite interesting--I won't spoil the fun for you. It comes towards the end of the book and is kind of an explanation of things that happen up until then.<br/><br/>Also, this book has Kazak: the hound of space!<br/><br/>Read it.",,,1,1

Socrates refuses on moral grounds. Here are some of my notes.<br/><br/>""Crito: 'But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be regarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good opinion.'<br/><br/>Socrates: 'I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the greatest evil; for then they also would be able to do the greatest good--and what a fine thing this would be! But in reality they can do neither; for they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is the result of chance.'""<br/><br/>I feel great empathy for Socrates and his disillusionment with groupthink and democracy in general. I watch the proceedings of courtroom juries and politics in America and see the same extreme dysfunction. It's sad--we've come so far but fall so short. On the flip side, I hear undertones of what I have found to be the converse truth: the greatest good is actually done on the individual level. My life has born much better fruit when I focused on what positive things I individually could do rather than worrying about politics/religion/other big things.<br/><br/>""And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man were destroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice? Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?""<br/><br/>He says it so precisely: the higher principles, whatever you want to call it (spirituality/morality/ethics/the social contract) must be of a higher nature than the body, the physical.<br/><br/>And then we come to Socrates' main argument for following the sentencing of the state. Because the state governs marriage, birth, and education, the state has an unequal relationship with Socrates--it is greater than he--and he should listen to it and obey it and not think himself greater than it.<br/><br/>I wish Crito argued back here. If he had I feel this dialogue would have been better. There are two main arguments I would like to have seen. The first is that Socrates himself established earlier that we should trust the opinion of experts more than that of the majority. But ""the state"" that Socrates is referring to is governed by the majority. Which is better, the opinion of experts or that of the majority? It appears to me to be a clear contradiction.<br/><br/>The second argument I would make would be that simply granting marriage certificates and birth certificates does not make the state legitimately the provider of those things. Marriage and birth are universal concepts and if a different state were here, or no state at all, people would still marry (or something akin to it) and still give birth. The state did not help me come into being (or have any authority over me) any more than me sticking a label on an item means that I caused that thing to come into being (or have any authority over it). And with education, this is only a financial transaction between taxpayers and their state. Partaking in such a transaction should in no way commit me to that state.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to learning about Antisthenes (pupil of Socrates) and Diogenes (pupil of Antisthenes). They established cynicism, which is a philosophical school I relate to greatly. It's not what you think. Cynicism is a mistrust of conventional worldly establishments that are contrary to nature. Perhaps the chiefest of these would be government and money, but it would also include many taboos and status symbols. Cynics practiced asceticism (self-denial) and living in accordance with nature. So far I don't know where Socrates and Antisthenes would agree or disagree, but Socrates' arguments in Crito really makes me curious to find out at some point.<br/><br/>I privately wonder if perhaps his real reasons for not wanting to flee Athens were more prosaic, although I would certainly give him the benefit of the doubt if I were able to argue with him, and let him try to show me this was not so. I believe there certainly can be a time when it is good and right that a man should accept death, and perhaps that was this time for Socrates.<br/><br/>I will say that although I disagree with Socrates' conclusions, I do admire several things about this dialogue. First, that Socrates is clearly a principled individual. He seeks to discover what is the right way to live and to do that at any cost (again, taking what he says at face-value). I also admire the stoic way he faces the end. To me the last line is beautiful. <br/><br/>""Leave me then, Crito, to fulfill the will of God, and to follow whither he leads.""",,,1,0

It is also one of the more religious of the dialogues, where he explains why he believes the gods have put him on this earth and how he has a relationship with a god that speaks to him only in the negative (telling him what not to do, but never what to do). It became clear to me from reading this that Socrates was really of the prophet type. Mouthpiece of the gods, speaking truth to power, all that. It helps you really understand his character well. Lots of interesting things here. <br/><br/>Socrates does go to great lengths to make fun of his opposition, which makes it a little weaker than other dialogues, but he's in a courtroom drama, where there are 501 jurors, and it's really kind of a popularity contest. He has to play a little bit more of the rhetorical / persuasive speech skills than he would in a normal dialogue. So this is, I think, fully understandable in the context. <br/><br/>It's a really short and easy read, especially compared to other dialogues. Highly recommended. Just read it.

Socrates: dunno, I can't even say what virtue is, nor have I ever met someone who knew what it was. Meno: like, omg, you're so dumb, I know what virtue is. Socrates: oh ok wise one, go ahead and drop some knowledge, I'm so glad that you're about to enlighten me. Meno: virtue is different for men and women and children. Socrates: that's not the same as giving a definition of what virtue itself is. If I asked you what the concept of ""shape"" is, you wouldn't tell me that it is different for squares and circles...you would tell me what squares and circles have in common, dumbass. Meno: oh ok, hold up...virtue is knowing what is beautiful and being able to acquire it. Socrates: ok first of all, by beautiful you just mean good right? (ok yeah fine). And second, so if someone acquires wealth at any cost that's virtuous? Meno: no, no...they have to acquire it in a virtuous way... Socrates: so you see your reasoning is circular right? Meno: dammit Socrates, you've got me all confused now. You're like this electric fish that benumbs things that get near it. Socrates: anyways let me go through a long process of teaching a random slave of yours some basic geometry, but check it out, I'm going to teach without teaching, by just asking questions. At first the slave thinks he knows something and then realizes he's totally wrong. Look Meno, the slave clearly is better off now than before right? So I'm not like a fish that benumbs people with electricity. Meno: damnit ok fine.<br/><br/>Now for a more serious review.<br/><br/>Socrates is brilliantly witty as usual. This dialogue starts with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught, and Socrates countering that he doesn't know what virtue is. Socrates invites Meno to tell him what virtue is, and as is the norm with Socrates' foils, Meno falls completely into the trap of arrogance, thinking he can describe it to Socrates. He quickly ends up in circular reasoning and says that Socrates makes him feel confused, benumbed, as if stung by an electric fish.<br/><br/>This dialogue also contains an explanation, in the middle, of why learning is actually recollection, which is very useful as it is referenced in other dialogues as well. To illustrate the point, Socrates has Meno take a random person from the crowd (one of Meno's slaves I think) and Socrates proceeds to go through some basic geometry with him--but only by asking leading questions, never by teaching. He shows that the slave at first thinks he knows something, and then is confused (by Socrates showing his is wrong), and then thinks he knows again, and then is confused again. By asking questions, Socrates teaches him some basic principles of geometry and says that he must have known these things all along since the slave is coming up with these opinions on his own, which must have existed prior. I thought this was interesting, and I would have countered that the slave was coming up with his opinions on the spot.<br/><br/>Next it goes into what I think is the main point of Meno: can virtue be taught? Socrates shows how many men are virtuous and yet their sons are not, and surely this shows that these men didn't know how to teach it, for if they did know, they would have gladly taught it to their sons, the same way that they taught their sons horsemanship and cobbling and other things. So it's shown that virtue isn't mere knowledge and in the end virtue is compared to how a prophet knows something (has a correct opinion) but does not know how he knows it (true knowledge). So those who are virtuous have a correct opinion without the knowledge of why it is correct (without the proof).<br/><br/>This was intriguing as always and I greatly enjoyed it. I wish I could be there and try out on Socrates my own definition of virtue and see how he would tear it apart. I would posit a definition that virtue is taking actions of loves towards others, and love is treating others better than one's self. I think I might argue that moderation is not one of the virtues, but I would probably keep the other set of virtues that the Greeks mentioned. It would be an interesting debate. Maybe I would have been obliterated. But it would have been enlightening, I'm sure. Socrates was a brilliant man.",,,1,0

It is right before Socrates' trial. He meets Euthyphro in a courtyard. Euthryphro is there prosecuting his own father for murder. This is considered very abnormal--normally it is virtuous for one to side with one's father--but in this case, Euthyphro believes he knows that it is the most virtuous to prosecute his father in this case, for he believes he knows better than anyone what is virtuous concerning piety--that is, what the gods want us to do.<br/><br/>S. proposes having E. explain to him what piety is, since E. is such a big expert on piety, and the main dialogue begins. From the beginning, E. has a huge ego, and S. flatters him and pretends that by having this dialogue with him, S. might learn from him what piety really is and therefore be saved in his upcoming trial.<br/><br/>This is never made explicitly clear, but I got the strong feeling that S. was really being ironic/mocking towards E. It was really quite funny to me as I'm somewhat familiar with Socrates' personality already. He's constantly flattering Euthyphro with saying, ""you're totally the most knowledgeable on piety, and I really want to know what answers you have to this question [that I already know from considerable experience is not answerable] so that it will save me in my trial..."" haha, as if.<br/><br/>Some context: later on in the trial Socrates will say that he has made many people angry at him because he has interviewed all kinds of people who thought they were wise and discovered by his line of questioning that they were not wise at all. And that's what is really happening with E.; Socrates is being polite about it, but he is showing that E.'s ideas boil down to circular reasoning. I feel like the flattering way he talks to E. is very tongue-in-cheek, and either E. doesn't realize that or goes along with it anyway.<br/><br/>Some quotes that I really liked:<br/>3c ""...the Athenians do not mind anyone they think clever, as long as he does not teach his own wisdom, but if they think he makes others to be like himself they get angry, whether through envy, as you say, or for some other reason."" -- I think this cultural phenomenon is both amusing and also explains why Plato chose to do all of his famous writings through the words of Socrates instead of himself.<br/><br/>14d ""I prefer nothing, unless it is true."" -- Quotes like this make me feel that Socrates and I would have been kindred spirits if we could have known each other.<br/><br/>I tracked the main argument of Euthyphro as thus:<br/><br/>12d Piety is a part of justice.<br/>12e Justice is care towards others. Piety is care of the gods, and the part of Justice that is not piety is care of people.<br/>13d Instead of talking of ""caring"" for the gods, we actually mean more like ""service"" towards the gods. For we don't ""care"" for them the way a hunter cares for his dogs or a stablemaster cares for horses.<br/>14d Piety is really the study of how to give and how to get from the gods. My sidenote: is this a good definition? If we compare this to how an underling relates to a general or an aide to a politician, would this hold up? Maybe.<br/>14e So piety is a trading skill between us and the gods.<br/>15a-b We can't benefit the gods at all. They only benefit from our ""honor, reverence, and [...] gratitude."" I'm pretty sure the implication--if I'm reading this right--is that they are saying that these are not really benefits. In 14e Socrates mentions that the gods get no goods from us in trade. So it sounds like they are only considering physical goods or tangible services as valid units of trade.<br/>15b Socrates says that Euthyphro's reasoning is circular, that he's really just saying that piety is what is dear to the gods, and what is dear to the gods is piety.<br/><br/>15a-b is where I would diverge in the dialogue. If I were there I would say that ""honor, reverence, and gratitude"" could actually be what the gods are totally after. That could count as a valid thing to trade to them in exchange. I would posit the example of a parent with children.<br/><br/>Why does the parent raise children? Do they children give them any tangible good, or render useful services to the parent that are commensurate with the vast amount of time and money the parent pours into the child? Clearly not. The parent raises the child so that the parent can have certain experiences, for example, so the parent can witness what it's like for a smaller version of themselves to grow up, and get to see something they are cultivating thrive and hopefully even see the world made a better place by their progeny.<br/><br/>So therefore the gods could do the same with us.<br/><br/>Reading dialogues always makes me really wish I was there to hear how they would respond. I'd like to imagine that someday in the afterlife I will get that chance.<br/><br/>Maybe Socrates would counter by saying, ""ok, but why do the gods desire to have those experiences?"" I would probably get stuck at that point.<br/><br/>This is definitely a solid dialogue worth reading. One doesn't have to believe in the same gods to appreciate the argument; just substitute the name of the god you believe in or call it Higher Truth or whatnot; the questions are still just as important and we should all ask ourselves what it really is to do right by God/The Universe.<br/><br/>I hope everyone reads this and several of Plato's other dialogues at some point. Contrary to popular belief, it's not hard to read Plato. Honestly, it's extremely straightforward, the opposite of how modern philosophers write just to impress themselves. Plato is very accessibly written, and Socrates' wit and humor make the philosophy go down just as easy as candy.",,,1,0

Not much is written that is true “study” material, to shed light on what the Bible, especially the Old Testament, really means. Christians affirm that we should read the Bible, but without good teaching about the Bible, most of the Old Testament—as well as many things in the New—are opaque, obtuse, and therefore essentially without meaning as we read them. Is blindly reading the Bible without understanding really that helpful? <br/><br/>A large group of Christians simply give up on reading the Bible at all. Another group reads it rotely without understand huge swaths of it or knowing how to apply it. Still another group just read the parts they like and skip the rest. The remainder who continually study and grow in their understanding are few, and I am not always among them. Many of us feel inundated in the genealogies, clueless in the sacrifices, lost in translations. <br/><br/>That is why we so desparately need to read books like this one, that delve into not fringe concepts or sectarian doctrine, but simply into the pure gospel, into the most important beliefs of orthodox Christianity, and explain them, using the Bible to interpret itself. I yearn to read more books like this that are like dense and nourishing, like waybread. Imagine eating cotton candy for years (popular Christian nonfiction) and then sinking your teeth into something dense and nutritious. You might have to adjust your expectation a little, but it is definitely the nourishment you have been lacking.<br/><br/>The topic of this book is the story of bread as told in the Bible. There is also a second story woven throughout, where the author tells the story of his life, each segment of which illustrates an aspect of the story of bread. I found myself fascinated by the depth of the former and intrigued by the latter. The Bible says a lot more about bread than I would have given it credit for, and it’s very meaningful. The offerings in Leviticus are explained and have provided a deep meaning (prefiguring Jesus among other things) for a section of scripture that previously was closed off to my understanding.<br/><br/>Speaking of things previously closed off to my understanding, he takes several genealogies and puts down the meanings of the names into poems that makes a lot of sense. Sometimes there are multiple meanings of a name so he picks the one that fits best. I found these very insightful; the very first one especially (the ten names from Adam to Abraham) was kind of mind-blowing.<br/><br/>Something he does a lot is points out patterns in scripture. For example he shows how the man of the flesh always precedes his corrolary man of the spirit. Adam precedes Christ. Yeasty bread precedes unlevened bread. The law comes before grace, Cain before Abel, Ishmael before Isaac, Esau before Jacob, Leah before Rachel, Saul before David. God sets things up the fleshy version of an archetype so that we can see the spirit version of that man/woman/type more clearly.<br/><br/>To give you an example of the kind of teaching that is in this book, here are some points from the first section on the Garden of Eden:<br/> - The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was probably a fig tree. They made the fig leaves from this tree. Our kind of clothing (knowledge of good and evil) is wholly inadequate to make us moral; it cannot cover our shame.<br/> - God put enmity between not just Eve and Satan, but rather, Eve’s seed and Satan’s seed. Satan’s seed comes about later in Genesis with the Nefilim, and Jesus mentions Satan’s seed in a parable about the wheat and the tares. Seed represents offspring or fruit…this ties into so much else in scripture. The phrase “seed of the woman” is a curious phrase and prefigure Christ, as he is the only human who has ever been born only of a woman but not a (human) man.<br/> - Abel sacrficed a lamb, prefiguring Christ, which was acceptable as a covering for sin (which God had just established by sacrificing animals to cover Adam and Eve). Cain’s sacrifice was not accepted because it was the fruit of the ground (his labors). Adam and Eve did not labor at all to earn the first garments that covered them. The covering for sin comes from God’s work alone.<br/><br/>That’s just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot of different parts of the Bible illuminated. The book of Ruth features heavily; so many of the weird actions are explained by understanding the culture. Also featured is Abraham, the children of Israel eating mana, Elijah living on bread from heaven, Ezekiel bread, and more. There’s also a section at the end going briefly through the New Testament, about Jesus, how he is the bread of life, etc. This was the only section I felt could have been expanded and improved.<br/><br/>This book does Christian nonfiction right in many ways. For one, its primary source is the Word of God itself, not just some dude’s opinions. Second, the primary way it interprets the Word of God is also through the Word of God, searching for patterns in it, rather than interpretting each verse piecemeal in the way that is most convenient to the author, or relying heavily on commentaries. He also pulls from some other sources besides the Bible, and these are mostly things that were written very soon after the Bible was written, not modern work in a completely different era. And finally, he applies it to examples in his own life, and does so in a daringly vulnerable way, hiding nothing, and encouraging me to do the same in my own life.<br/><br/>I am surprised at my own enthusaism in reviewing this. I think one of the reasons—besides how good the book is—is that I feel I have been in a desert for so long. I was parched, drinking the dehydrating soda of most modern Christian nonfiction, and now I’ve rediscovered water: true scholarship that is all about exploring the actual Word of God in depth. This book is full of insights about scripture that I have never noticed before in the many times that I have read the Bible. Time and time again, while reading this, I would say, “wow! That’s true, that is a pattern in scripture. That pattern not only applies to the 2-3 examples he is mentioning in this book, but also to 1-2 other examples that are popping to my mind. This is an accurate observation and I now know the Bible better!” After saying this to myself (in not so many words) I would make a note on an index card and continue reading. I ended up with 70-something notes, most of which were moments like that, and some of which were riveting accounts from the author’s personal life.<br/><br/>I will give a disclosure. I am acquainted with the author. However, I honestly don’t think that influenced my experience of the book much. I pride myself in being objective. As the leader of a writer’s group, I’m used to being brutally honest with my writing friends. But there was no major criticism I had for this work. I’ve read a lot, and this was one of the best books I’ve read on the Bible, and I will cherish it for years to come. I’m considering leading a Bible study on it.",,,1,1

In this case, God is a super AI who has been setup to watch over mankind and can communicate into their minds via means not spelled out. It’s computing power comes from satellites in the sky which have been slowly falling out of the sky for millions of years. As it loses computing power, it loses its ability to keep the planet, Harmony, in stasis forever. And so it needs to act, and this is the story of what it does, and the story mostly of a particular family that it decides to use.<br/><br/>The story is really about the theme of hearing from God, and exploring that in many nuances as the main character struggles with the concept in many ways. So there’s ideas about what is free will, what is freedom, how do I hear correctly and get myself out of the way, how do I not lose my own sense of agency and self, etc. And the twist is, since this Oversoul (that’s what it is called) is actually a really powerful AI, but is not actually God...there are some interesting ethical questions that come up from that.<br/><br/>If you enjoy asking these questions and exploring them you’ll probably really enjoy this. However if you are firmly atheistic then this would have very little appeal. I could see people making the argument that most of his plot is often driven through Deus Ex Machina events, that the plot is moved forward by the Oversoul (God) stepping in and doing what would otherwise be impossible. However, if you see the Oversoul as a character with real limitations (which are described in general terms and stuck to throughout the book), then it doesn’t really feel like Deus Ex Machina. At least that was my experience.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the world building of different cultures on this planet, and especially of the “holy” city it is mostly set in, the warring factions and the interesting way that families are structured. <br/><br/>The book has a solid pace, a solid ending, and definitely makes you want to read the next one. It’s not for everyone, but for many I would heartily recommend it.<br/>",,,1,0

As in Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn is brilliantly hilarious. It has a large section of it dedicated to fraudsters, while Tom Sawyer is focused more on everyday people in a small town. Huck Finn includes many small towns as well but focuses more on a black man, Jim, who has runaway. Most of the book is about Huck and Jim, but there's a wide cast of other characters, and two fraudsters take up several chapters. The scams they pull over on people are comical, tragic, and sad.<br/><br/>The book has a considerable commentary, especially in the later half, on slavery and morality--often overlapping. It's a bit odd/uncomfortable to read Huck's perspective, which is that by helping Jim escape, he is doing something terribly wrong. His conscious is constantly pricking him to turn Jim in. While this is uncomfortable to read, that doesn't make it bad. This book is simply showing us Huck's perspective as it is--Twain never preaches a morality message with his stories; he simply describes human nature and lets us draw our own conclusions.<br/><br/><spoiler>I will say though, it was an odd sense of relief when Huck finally chooses to just commit himself to freeing Jim--and therefore commit himself to being destined, in his mind, for Hellfire. Such an odd feeling, reading that.</spoiler> <br/><br/>I couldn't quite bring myself to give this five stars. What bothered me was that it dragged in places in a repetitive way, especially towards the end. For example in the ways that Tom insists on book-romanticizing things...it was hilarious at first, but it just got really repetitive. <br/><br/>With that said, this book really helps you get outside of yourself and into someone else's thoughts and experiences, and for that it is brilliant, let alone the comedy, the characters, the dialects, and the rich exploration of river culture in Missouri.",,,1,1

It first defines the problem, then gives the history of the Benedictine Order, draws parallels with that period of time when the Roman Empire was declining and the Catholic church had become festeringly corrupt at the highest levels. It explains the principles of Benedict in its nuances, and then spends the rest of the book applying these principles to many different topics that are critical to Christians in the U.S. today. <br/><br/>I really appreciated the structure of it. The many small subsections of the later chapters focus on how to apply Godly principles to very specific topics. He always gives examples, stories, and quotations. In this way, he manages to give us a general guidebook that is both broad and yet focused.<br/><br/>I didn't agree with all of the specific rules of the Benedict Order, nor did I agree with every one of Dreher's prescriptions for modern society. For example, I think his chapter on technology was quite sub-par; it doesn't sound to me that he has contemplated what technology really is. In my ethics class in college, there were two really good books on the philosophy and ethics of technology, however, despite racking my brains out, I cannot remember the names of them. If I do I will update this review.<br/><br/>I don't think, however, that a book like this should be rated based on you agreeing with every single stance that the author takes on applying the Word of God to modern Christian life. The point is to genuinely try, and to learn from the principles of the Benedictine Order. I think this book succeeds at conveying these principles and why they work.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that in a situation where Christianity has gone from mainstream to weakened, Christians should not remain apart of the world, but withdraw from it, to focus in enclaves on how to build up a culture of orthodox Christianity and Western thought. The answer to our situation is not through political power, for A) we aren't the majority any more, and B) that avenue was never what Jesus teached anyway: he taught strength through weakness. Most importantly, we have to have a strong culture that is very distinct from the world. If the church looks too much like the world, that's not how you attract people, in fact, it does just the opposite in the long run. We must define the problem and define the solution(s) by showing by example.<br/><br/>As you can see I agree with the author's main premise. But even if I hadn't, I would have respected the level of examples, stories, quotes, and breadth of scope in a condensed form. This isn't really a book for exploring all of these topics (sexuality, technology, education, church life, community, etc) in great depth, but it does have enough depth in each of them to be meaningful. I would recommend this book as first, an agent of clarity to a believer who wants to be meaningfully Christian in practical terms, and second, as a spring-board to learning more about all of the topics mentioned.<br/><br/>I've already given my copy of this to a friend and recommended it to a couple others. I hope even more Christians will read this.",,,1,1

Norton & Company,Paperback,328,2000,1438,2021/10/09,2020/07/19,,,read,"This was the first autobiography every written, although technically, Margery Kempe didn't physically write it with her own hand, but dictated it to two different priests. This is the 1400s Medieval England and people are crazy about religion, but none perhaps as much as Margery. The book covers all of her adult life, starting with the first time she (as a young mother, perhaps suffering post-pardum) began experiencing visions of Jesus' crucifixion and experiencing uncontrollable sobbing. Prior to this Margery describes herself as not being really interested in spiritual matters. But she becomes overwhelmed with love of Jesus and being wrecked by the love of all He did for us.<br/><br/>Basically, everywhere she went (she went on pilgrimages and other trips), people reacted to her loud sobbings with confusion, revilement, and occasionally with curiosity and understanding. Oftentimes the populace are reacting very negatively to her and a friar or priest intervenes on her behalf, telling them that they shouldn't be angry with a woman who is sobbing for how much Jesus loved us. But sometimes even the priests and friars are against her, sometimes barring her from attending certain masses or other events. She had a very hard life, socially. To think that some people would accuse her of faking crying--no one would fake that. It made life miserable for her many times. She asked God to remove this from her but she heard Him say that it was His will for her to go through this to bring glory to Him.<br/><br/>The chapters are very short, there's about 100 of them. Each chapter, I think, was probably one session of her dictating on a particular evening. The chapters are not in strictly chronological order, but that's not as confusing as you would think, for she continually acknowledges any confusing things but explaining that this event happened after such-and-such that we already talked about, etc.<br/><br/>Despite being written 600 years ago, the language was pretty coherent. There were only a small handful of words I wasn't familiar with, and the Oxford edition of my book had footnotes to explain some of them; the others I found by googling. Again though, only a small handful.<br/><br/>Margery is one of the female mystics of the Medieval ages. The mystics emphasized visualizing Heaven or Jesus or events that happened in the Bible. In Margery's case, particularly the latter two. There was another female mystic during this period, Julian of Norwich, who was more noteworthy and who Margery briefly meets with. I plan on reading Julian's book next.<br/><br/>This book was of interest to me from a historical perspective, but I can say that you really shouldn't come to the book expecting to get a whole lot of historical detail explained. Places and events are referenced only in passing and nothing is really explained. Margery is really focused on only writing about what she thinks is important, which is basically just her spiritual experiences and how those played out in society. She doesn't tell us anything about her childhood, teenagehood, her children (except for one particular story where one of her 10-ish children became a believer), or really most aspects of her life except as they are related to her spiritual experiences. As such it got a bit monotonous to be transparent. The vast amount of similar weeping experiences and reactions of people were a bit stultifying. <br/><br/>However what I found more interesting were some of the things God spoke to her in her heart. I didn't necessarily agree with all of them--after all this is when everyone was Catholic and believed in purgatory and other such things that I don't agree with--but there were many gems there nonetheless. I took notes and wrote down many.<br/><br/>So while this wasn't necessarily the best thing I've ever read, I am glad that I read it. It will probably be several years till I reread it. I do recommend that Christians read this, especially if you have any interest in discovering what Christians of other times experienced, if you want to get a full broad swathe of Christianity, then this is for you. But if you're not a Christian don't even bother reading this; you will probably be bored and/or hate it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I know Margery. I wish I could have met her.",,,1,0

At first, as I started reading I noticed that these were written in the 50s and 60s and thought they might be outdated. There were a few silly ideas, however, those were greatly outshined by so many things these short stories and novellas did well.<br/><br/>Flowers for Algernon is now one of my favorite short stories. I actually shed a couple of tears, and immediately went back and read it again. Deeply moving in a way that is not at all forced or cliche. Truly a one-of-a-kind story of great lasting power.<br/><br/>The Darftsteller - I found the concept to be quite unrealistic, however it was still thought out in depth and it was an evocative kind of ending. 3/5<br/><br/>Allamagoosa - very punchy and powerful. Quite funny. 5/5<br/><br/>Exploration Team - memorable for the fact that the main character had pet bears and a pet eagle. Otherwise a bit forgettable. 3/5.<br/><br/>The Star - very short, very poetic and reminiscent, powerful concept. 5/5<br/><br/>Of All the Seas with Oysters - quite silly but short and funny. Notable for its absurdity. 4/5<br/><br/>The Big Front Yard - notable character and ideas, although altogether unplausible. But the characters saved it for me, and that it was set in a small country town. 3/5.<br/><br/>The Hell-Bound Train - this was not a scifi story, but clearly fantasy. With that being said, it was a good standard story, well worth reading.<br/><br/>The Longest Voyage - a concept I really enjoy, where on another planet they are in the process of having their ""Christopher Columbus"" moment of circumnavigating the globe, but with the twist of discovering a starship that's visiting from elsewhere. I enjoyed the concept and the descriptions of ship life, as well as really noted some interesting concepts this author toys with when it comes to how things might look different on other planets. I found the ending altogether implausible, but it still had an interesting thought behind it, for sure. Overall I found the world-building quite good, although he throws around terms that are unexplained and only mentioned one time too often. I feel this author would probably be best to read in novel format and look forward to reading more Poul Anderson. For this particular story I'll say 3.5/5.<br/><br/>Overall a solid collection.

I was very intrigued to think that Mary of Magdala may have written a gospel, and it sounded very believable to me that perhaps it was destroyed for bad reasons. However, on reading this, it is very clear it was something revisionist, written with gnosticism in mind, from a mindset that didn't even exist when Jesus was alive. Unfortunately, there's not much here that I consider very inspired.  But there are a couple of gems.",,,1,0

I was surprised at how much I was drawn back to this again and again. There is something about Faulkner's writing that draws me in. It's beautiful and you are so comfortably in these people's heads.<br/><br/>The ending was great; unexpected and yet it makes perfect sense as you think about it. I will also note that while the story starts off slow for a while, in the second half a lot of things happen. It was quite rewarding.<br/><br/>The one downside is that sometimes Faulkner is impossible to understand. Many times you can understand it by reading it again, thinking about it, reading before and after...then finally it makes sense.  But sometimes there is just no way to understand what he is meaning and this is frustrating.<br/><br/>The only other criticism I have is that the characters sound too similar too each other. They have the same thought pattern, or at least very similar. They are different in some ways but the same in the ways that their stream of conciousness flows. Besides that though the characterizations are amazing; really the characters are what make this book.<br/><br/>I'm very glad I read this.<br/>",,,1,0

Consider yourself warned, because there is a major turning point in this book.<br/><br/>Now with that out of the way...this was such an interesting experience. About 2/3 of the way through the book my one criticism was that I didn't know where this was leading me. I began to wonder if this had a coherent theme/plot. Typically when writing, you want to let the reader know what the point is early on so they know how to read. However, I think this book is the perfect counter-example. The reason is that the theme is grief: specifically, a child dealing with the loss of a bosom friend, cut down at a young age.<br/><br/>I was completely surprised at this turn of events. I rapidly finished the book and was amazed at the depth and complexity that Paterson explored sadness with. There were so many concepts packed into those last few chapters. At the time I was reading this to my wife out loud. (We read children's books together sometimes for multiple reasons, because we enjoy good children's books, and as inspiration for our own creative endeavors, and so we know what will be good for our future kids.) Having to read those last three chapters out loud proved a monumental task. I cried throughout. I cannot recall the last time--if ever--that a book explored the theme of grief in such a thorough, meaningful way to me.<br/><br/>I want to return to this concept of letting the reader know what kind of story the book is from the beginning. The reason Bridge to Terabithia works so well in my opinion is that the way you read the story mirrors the way that we experience grief in our own lives: we go about our lives blithely unaware of the tragedy about to come. We enjoy our moments with our loved ones, but we don't *know* to be foreseeing special significance into everything that happens, everything she says and does...we're just living our normal lives. The first 3/4 of the book are just that: scenes from life, done well and vividly, with the connecting thread being the Jess's developing friendship with Leslie. And then bam, when tragedy hits, it is sudden and unexpected, and suddenly we have to deal with this. That's the way it is in real life and that's the way it is in this book.<br/><br/>This book is truly a work of ark that is as thoroughly enjoyable as it is meaningful. I don't know if I've ever gotten so much out of a children's book. Cannot recommend enough, with the caveat that children should be the right age before reading it/having it read to them.",true,,1,0

But the real clincher is the content.<br/><br/>This story might be classified as pre-feminist, before there was such a thing as feminist literature. In a world where women are held to a double standard, Thomas hits the nail on the head and I feel so much compassion for Tess and anger at the system, that in many ways, this novel could be classified as more a dystopia than a tragedy, although it is that as well.<br/><br/>The ending is perfect in several ways. Its shift in perspective makes it even more chilling, and it's very fitting for the effect he is achieving. I won't say any more than that so as not to ruin it for others.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fact that his novel (and I think all his novels are this way, from what I have read) is very grounded in a specific place (1800s Wessex). I learned a little about milking cows and what starve-acre farms are like, how the industrial revolution was impacting farmers and villages during that time period, etc. But never did I feel beat over the head with the information.<br/><br/>He also has such a sense of nuanced characters...it's wonderful.<br/><br/>And he is good at creating evocative places and scenes.<br/><br/>Really, Thomas is wonderful in many ways. I can say unreservedly that this is a truly great novel, not only for the cleverness of the plots and the social layers he penetrates, but also because he has so much heart. I have the feeling that Thomas Hardy was someone I would have dearly loved if I knew him as a person. <br/><br/>I can't wait to read his other works.",,,1,0

Normally I dislike narratives that jump around in time. And the narrative is disjointed with the half-senile narrator's (seemingly, but not) random thoughts and memories interspersed. This book also completely breaks any expectation you might have of suspense, as it tells you right in the first chapter all of the most important things that are going to happen in the climax--that is, if you think of the plot in conventional terms.<br/><br/>So right from the first chapter I was amazed at how good it was, at how well that the book pulled me in while not doing most of the things I would expect from a good novel. The story is told by an old vet who's probably losing his marbles a bit. There are seemingly random memories and thoughts interspersed throughout the telling of a story--but they're not random at all; they actually make sense in how they relate to other concepts around them and reveal so much...that first chapter is one of the most beautiful, impressive works of literary art I have ever read.<br/><br/>I can't say the rest of the book is quite as good as the first chapter, but it is good. Concepts included: time being circular (which, btw, is embodied in the way the book is written), fate vs free will, the absurdity of war, and the idea of massacre--from many angles. <br/><br/>He is showing that massacre can't be rationalized, and also that there's no point in just talking about how massacre is bad; in fact the story gives up on the idea of trying to make massacre a part of a traditional story; in short, it shows the absurdity of trying to make sense of massacre in any way. The massacre JUST IS. And in addition, (re other ideas about time and free will), the massacre always was, and always will be. He makes it clear from chapter one he's not trying to write a traditional anti-war book (as in: hey look, war is bad, we should all protest war). He's trying to do something much more personal and creative than that. <br/><br/>Read the book. It's less than 200 pages. It's an amazing work of art.",,,1,0

This amount of examples is both this book’s strength and weakness. If trying to just read straight through quickly, the number of examples can feel repetitive, unnecessary.

It also provides a marvelous breadth of the vast domain of literature and opens your mind to expanding your variety of literary diet.<br/><br/>What this book does is pretty simple but vitally important and altogether under-emphasized: let us simply fall in love with reading again.

It fulfills the expectations of fantasy readers, but it does it in original, quirky, and interesting ways. Its greatest strength is its majestic worldbuilding, which its author reveals gradually without getting too lost in the weeds, which is a difficult balance that he has perfected.<br/><br/>Its protagonist, Theo, is somewhat of an unwilling hero, but not in the traditional sense...he is unwilling because he knows the truth, that he has very little power in the world. This was a theme throughout the book, and I found it to be done very well. What little power he does have, he learns to use. And it does make a difference. So this isn't depressing or defeatist. No, it simply feels very grounded in reality: that's the case for most of us. Most of us aren't Aragorn who can take on armies singlehandedly. That's a nice escapist fantasy that doesn't translate at all to our real lives. No, most of us have a very limited influence on this life...but we DO have an influence and it DOES matter.<br/><br/>So many things are done well in this book. The dialogue, the pacing, the descriptions, the changes in the main character, the way he reveals the world a shade at a time. I could go on and on. This book was well-balanced, engaging, thorough, sometimes humorous, and overall, very satisfying. Bravo to the author for pulling off so many things at once.",,,1,0

I fell in love with his poetic style and the fact that he writes primarily about ordinary working class people, not just the ultra wealthy, like so many authors who he might be compared to. <br/><br/>I love stories from the 1800s but there’s only so much I can take of reading about self important nobility complaining about the tiniest discomforts of life. So it’s been refreshing to get to know Hardy: finally we can learn what it was like to be a milk maid, or a mason, or a shepherd, what life was like for them, and the social issues of the time.<br/><br/>His language is also just exquisitely poetic (which makes sense, Hardy was also a prolific poet). And I also just got the sense that Hardy was a keen observer and very empathetic, the kind of person I’d actually enjoy being friends with.<br/><br/>So I was immediately drawn in to read more by Hardy and bought Far From the Madding Crowd and Jude the Obscure. So I’ve read middle Hardy, early Hardy, and late Hardy, in that order.<br/><br/>What’s true of all of them is the highly poetic language and internalization of nature to an inner emotional landscape. He’s also great at showing just how messed up society can be around marriage in particular, but there’s class issues and sexism and other meaty things as well.<br/><br/>Far From the Madding Crowd is overwrought with the language. He goes overboard with always using the biggest word in the dictionary; it’s like he hadn’t yet learned to exercise restraint and really become perfectly balanced like in Tess.<br/><br/>It also has a heroine who is much less likable than the other books. And who names their daughter Bathsheba? She is admirable for being thrust into a difficult situation and rising to the occasion however.<br/><br/>Her foil, Gabriel Oak the shepherd on the other hand, is quite likable. The poor guy is lacking some social graces but really just wants to be of service to Bathsheba. He’s also just a very interesting character, a shepherd who’s more interested in astronomy than his sheep; a reader and a deep soul. <br/><br/>There are some other characters and love interests that create and hold a lot of tension.<br/><br/>As always there is some terrible fate that befalls some characters. Don’t read Hardy if you want everyone to live happily ever after. He’s pretty intense on the tragedy.<br/><br/>Overall I’m still glad I read this, but I wouldn’t start here with Hardy.

Sometimes pretty repetitious. I don't see Seneca as a hypocrite like others do. I think people like to tear down anyone who sets high standards. Seneca didn't claim to be perfect, just to be striving for an ideal. And compared to his contemporaries, he went far towards it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't completely get behind his ideal--at least, not the way he goes about it. The ""way"" which I refer to is that he simply tries to control and stifle emotions. I believe in his ideal of not allowing emotions to rule us. But the path to that, I think, goes through actually feeling and dealing with your emotions, not simply trying to deny that they exist. Of course in all fairness, Seneca was over a thousand years before any kind of understanding of how emotions work had been done. So he shouldn't be faulted for that.<br/><br/>Why should you read this? Because he's a master essayist, for one. These are really essays wrapped in an ""epistolary"" (letter-like) form. He's a master of style and full of thought-provoking ideas. And above all else, you should read this because Seneca believed in philosophy as a means of improving how one lived. It's clear he would staunchly oppose today's philosophers, for he makes it clear that philosophy is degraded when it devolves into philology (the study of words) or when it becomes divorced from how to improve one's self; that is, is theory only. In this respect, he is a man after my own heart.<br/><br/>The voice is of an old crotchety man, but one who is effective, transparent, and wise. I feel like I'm talking to my (now deceased) grandfather who was a retired professor. This voice is dear to my heart and I'm sure I will be returning to it again and again.<br/><br/>And now for some excerpts on what Seneca had to say about various topics.<br/><br/><u>Grief</u><br/>He writes a letter to Lucilius after the latter has experienced the loss of a close friend. Seneca's advice varies considerably. At one point he says that the ideal is to not grieve at all, but concedes that this is not possible.<br/><br/>At another point he says that it is good that a stoic should shed a few tears, but not too many, because carrying on and making great displays of grief is not really about the person you are grieving. He has observed that most people who make huge displays of grief did not, in fact, spend any time with the friend in life. They are making large overtures of grief to convince others--or themselves--that they really did care for the person.<br/><br/><u>Absence in friendship</u><br/>He says that being absent from a friend is a finer pleasure than being present with them. He also espouses letters over talking in person. He says to take stock of: how often when you live in proximity to a friend do you actually see them? You allow great stretches of time to go by without seeing them at all. But when absent from a friend, one is more intentional.<br/><br/><u>Death</u><br/>""You will die not because of illness, but because you are alive.""<br/>Caligula once was passing by a slave who asked to be put to death. ""So then,"" he said, ""You are alive, as you are now?""<br/>""[Everything is slavery.] Life itself is slavery, if the courage to die is lacking.""<br/>Don't seek for longevity of life. ""Length does not matter; only, have a good ending.""<br/><br/><u>Fear of Death</u><br/>He insists that people are mainly afraid of death because they don't want to lose the delicatessens, the pleasures of life. And yet haven't you already spent your whole life sampling these pleasures thousands of times? There is nothing new to be gained there.<br/><br/>He also states repeatedly that he is not afraid of death because it is either a transition or an end. And even if it is an end, it is simply to cease to exist, and he already was in that state before he was born.<br/><br/><u>Death - my Response</u><br/>He has a lot of great points, but taken as a whole, I feel his stance on death starts to feel a little hollow. First of all, there is always more to be accomplished in life, not merely the sampling of new pleasures. There are always new books to write, friendships to deepen, places to see, things to learn. Children and grandchildren to watch grow up. Deeds to do worth doing.<br/><br/>Second, if death is to cease to exist, then there could be nothing worthwhile about it. One cannot learn or grow or affect things or be affected. One has absolutely nothing if one does not exist.<br/><br/>And if death is a transition, the problem is that it is a transition into the complete unknown. Nothing is more natural than to fear the unknown--this does not mean one should be ruled by that fear--but it is completely natural.<br/><br/>A man who does not fear death is a fool, perhaps, I say, for he either pretends to feel no fear or, worse, actually doesn't feel it in the most natural of situations, which would indicate something was fundamentally ill in his psyche.",,,1,0

The writing is very good.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like is that two of the points of view (out of six) are characters that are pretentious and insufferable, especially with their overwrought and absurd diction, showing off with ridiculous words and metaphors. It felt overdone and for whatever reason made my eyes roll instead of feeling enjoyable.<br/><br/>With that said, that fades away as the book gets going and the second half doesn't have that style as much.<br/><br/>The plots are good, the stories are interesting, it's all done very well otherwise. This book has a very interesting structure where there are six stories being told. All of them (except the middle one) are split into two parts. So Story A is split into two with its first half being the first thing you read in the whole book, and the second half being the last thing you read in the book. Inside of that you have Story B, and inside of B you have C, all the way to F in the middle.

I love his use of poetic language and how he applies it to characters and their experiences.<br/><br/>I really loved this book’s feel from the beginning, of this obscure boy who nobody wanted who communed with the stars and dreamed of going to Christminster (Hardy’s alias for Oxford). I love how Hardy explores obscure people’s lives and gives them meaning. In addition to being that, this work also feels a bit autobiographical (just guessing).<br/><br/>This book is a direct critique, if not outright attack, on the institution of marriage. I was surprised to read in some of the reviews that there was question as to whether it was moralistic or not. To my eyes it was quite straightforwardly so. The primary moral, which is quite explicitly put forth in great detail by the two main characters, is that it is harmful to prevent married people from divorcing (or making it so very onerous as it was in Hardy’s day, regarding the way that society would treat you afterwards).<br/><br/>Besides that moral, there are several other related morals that are less forcefully brought up, and may be considered more as general critiques of how culture handles marriage. It points out that people get married without really knowing what they're doing and for all the wrong reasons, pressure from society, being outright tricked (I'm pregnant...jk), guilt, for appearances, etc. It points out that marrying can have negative effects on one’s love (feelings) for their spouse. It points out that in some circumstances, if you have lived together for long enough and acted married for long enough, it really seems more natural and substantive to consider that person to be married to you rather than someone who you may be married to on paper but haven’t seen in years.<br/><br/>It also shows (and this I found to be valuable) how cruel that society could be in that time toward people who flaunted traditional marriage customs. In one scene, Jude and his not-wife are repairing some stone masonry in a church, in particular, a ten commandments edifice. When some passersby happen upon them doing their work and begin discussing rumors about the couple, this escalates to a certain point, and then the parson has to fire them—not for having done anything wrong, but just for appearance’s sake. He does kindly pay them for the rest of the weeks’ work. But I can imagine how I would feel in that circumstance. There are several other scenes that show them being denied employment and lodging, which affects not just them, but their children, to very cruel effect. It feels quite realistic and I wonder if that is why this book pissed off so many people.<br/><br/>That’s a theme that I see in all of Thomas Hardy’s books that I have read so far: how cruel society can be, how it can even threaten the very survival of people who aren’t conforming to the conventions which are dictated by popular moral ideas. I love Thomas Hardy for exploring that theme. I’m a Christian who, instead of shrinking away from such uncomfortable discussions, wants to lean into them; I find them incredibly important.<br/><br/>My parents divorced when I was 12. It had been a miserable marriage for quite some time leading up till that point. I won’t go into all the details, but suffice it to say, as someone who spends inordinate amounts of time contemplating matters like these, I feel 100% confident that life was better for everyone. Unless an act of God happened, that marriage was not going in a positive direction.<br/><br/>By nature, as a child, I was an idealist. I didn’t want my parents to get divorced, and I felt a sense of wrongness. However, experience has a way of beating down your ideals sometimes. Enough pain over enough time doesn’t necessarily destroy the ideal, it just forces you to accept that the ideal isn’t always a sensible thing to pursue.<br/><br/>So anyways. I don’t approach this question from some naive perspective, happy to hand-wave at others’ suffering as I hold fast to dogma. That’s not where I’m coming from at all. What I am is a seeker of Truth. I really want to know what the Truth is, what Truths can be learned about life and can be applied to questions like these. I’m married right now, have been for 7 years. It’s either the most difficult thing I’ve ever done or the second most (apples and oranges are hard to compare). And this has caused me to examine in an intensely personal philosophic way: what is the purpose of marriage? When is divorce actually helpful?<br/><br/>Here’s what I took away from Hardy’s book.<br/><br/>It’s a broken system when divorced people are treated worse than married people. My dad couldn’t be a deacon in his church simply because he was divorced. There were stigmas toward my mother. There were stigmas toward my family, at my Christian school. It could have been worse. It wasn’t like what Hardy described. But I can get behind this idea of his. It simply is harmful; I don't see a benefit.<br/><br/>I spent some time trying to write about and give my opinions on several other topics related to divorce and marriage, and then quickly discovered I was in over my head. Having thrown away those paragraphs, I will summarize thus. I think Thomas Hardy brings up a lot of real problems with how society handled marriage and divorce, esp in that day, and a couple of fake problems which I thought were red herrings. I also think the book would have benefited from examining the other side of the coin; he never anticipated the counter-arguments and tried to address them, and never gave counter-examples. Where are the happily married couples, or the people who grew to love each other more over time? Curiously, none of those people exist in Hardy's world. So I didn’t find it to be a thorough treatment of the theme.<br/><br/>However, with that said, I think it has a lot of valuable food for discussion and critical reasoning on the topic of marriage and for that reason alone it is a very worthwhile work. It may be that Hardy wasn’t trying to present the other side of the coin because he was writing for a very different audience that was incensed or outraged at things that today are non-problems; their reactions seem bizarre to us. Back then divorce was scandalous to the point of being practically a non-option for most people if they didn’t want to ruin their lives. It wasn’t illegal…it was just that all the societal consequences you would face would be drastic enough to ruin you. That’s not true choice; just the illusion of it. So maybe it made a lot more sense for Hardy to treat the subject that way; he was really trying to make an unpopular point for (in some ways) the first time. So his non-thoroughness can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Today I think our culture is in a very different place, where divorce is often turned to quickly, or even assumed at the onset of marriage. I think a lot of people have lost track of the value of marriage as an instrument for becoming a better person. People have also become less used to pain and difficulty, and no longer see it as the good thing that it truly is. When I’m going through “another fucking growth opportunity,” yes, I don’t have a good attitude often. But in the big picture, this does not change my philosophy on life. I know from countless experiences that I must embrace pain in order to grow, and avoiding pain only causes me to stagnate. <br/><br/>Anyways. There is so much that could be written on this subject and I am certainly not ready to do a thorough treatment of it. So I will stop trying for now and instead simply say that this book by Hardy is good, it is poetic and makes some good points if a bit moralistically in parts, but on the whole it is not so moralistic, but rather just quite focused on showing every problem with the institution of marriage (as implemented in his society) that Hardy could muster. It is also sad, to the point of being depressing in parts. Particularly gruesome is the <spoiler>child suicide/homicide</spoiler>.<br/><br/>Also, I almost forgot to mention one of the themes was the difficulty in being allowed to get a higher education if you weren't born into privilege. I took great interest in seeing how a no-name stonemason would go about trying to get educated in this time period if he were particularly determined. This book answers that question. Spoiler: it sucked.<br/><br/>I am very sorry that he received such intense backlash in his day from this book to the point that he quit writing novels (yes, that was the reason he gave, whether that was a cop-out excuse or not we will never know). I disagree with Hardy on many points about marriage (at least what I think his points were), but I never would have attacked or censored someone for writing a book eloquently making a case that I disagreed with. I’m glad he wrote it and shook up Victorian sensibilities. I’m sad there were no more books after this one.<br/><br/>It shouldn’t have been so controversial as it was. And by that I just mean that I'm against censorship in all its forms. Arguing about controversial topics is essential. Unfortunately, though, most people, when discussing a controversial topic, just resort to dogma instead of a reasoned conversation. I would have loved to engage with Hardy on this topic or any other. I think he was a great man, a reasonable man, and one of those few souls who were gifted with intelligence and compassion in equal measures.

It also feels very complete, even-handed, and it views things from multiple dimensions. It follows the stories of two different individual people (one of the King Louis, and the other a glassmaker named Menetre) in addition to the broader descriptions. It pulls together from a huge number of sources and has many endnotes if you want to go deeper. And all this while still managing to be very engaging (sans the last fourth of the book, which is just inherently a less interesting phase of the revolution as it fizzled out and was gradually dismantled by the Thermidorians and Napoleon). <br/><br/>Popkin even does a good job of foreshadowing, introducing important characters and foreshadowing important events before they happening. I don't think I've ever read a history book before where I genuinely just really wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next.<br/><br/>He addresses many of the glaring faults of different revolutionaries and doesn't really making anyone into a saint. He addresses questions that we as modern readers would be more interested in, such as the revolutionaries' treatment of women and slaves. He also tells you which things had lasting effects hundreds of years into the future and what those affects were, which helps you understand how important certain things were, as well as which things quickly fizzled out and went nowhere. He makes the time period very fascinating, and pitches it as being a period where there was a cauldron or incubator of every idea imaginable about government and representation, etc. So many things were first tried here. You can see the seeds of communism, fascism, women's rights, the end of slavery, anti-colonialism, and so many other things here. <br/><br/>It's a time of great desperation and violence, where even women stage violent uprisings, often because people are starving. It's also the age of many enlightenment ideas getting tried out for the first time. It's an age of so many things. He explores at the beginning what conditions led to this era happening. He also explores why it developed the way it did, why he doesn't think the French Revolution was inevitable, and what King Louis could have done differently to avert it.<br/><br/>He also shows the rise of Napoleon, although this book isn't primarily about him, but it's a good introduction to his character and importance to ending the French Revolutionary period. I get a feeling this is an ideal thing to read first and then launch into reading a more detailed biography of Napoleon, and/or history of the Napoleonic Wars. By the way, if you didn't know anything about Napoleon, don't get your hopes up to high. He was quite racist and authoritarian, not a hero of our time, but he is a very fascinating character in history.<br/><br/>There are so many other good things I could say about this book.

Well, for me, anyways. I bought a book on <i>whimsy</i>. Normally I research to death first, but this time, this one time, I saw a book called <i>Assassin’s Apprentice</i> by Robin Hobb, and picked it up capriciously—the author’s last name was almost identical to my own—and I began reading.<br/><br/>“My pen falters, then falls from my knuckly grip, leaving a worm’s trail of ink across Fedwren’s paper. I have spoiled another leaf of the fine stuff, in what I suspect is a futile endeavor. I wonder if I can write this history, or if on every page there will be some sneaking show of a bitterness I thought long dead. I think myself cured of all spite, but when I touch pen to paper, the hurt of a boy bleeds out with the sea-spawned ink, until I suspect each carefully formed black letter scabs over some ancient scarlet wound.”<br/><br/>And then he goes on to describe his first memory as a boy, his hand gripped in a much larger, callused hand, dragged to massive fortress doors on a dark night of icy gray rain. And as the narrator describes these things, these little memoir-like asides creep in, these comments wondering about his lack of memories, comments mentioning drugs and bitterness and death, as if from the perspective of a very old man looking back over a lifetime of hurt and regrets and…life.<br/><br/>Immediately there was something about this that felt cozy and comfortable and exciting all at once. All I knew was that this book was “large” enough to contain both coziness and adventure and sadness and rawness—having “assassin” in the title, after all—and that was enough for me. I bought it, took it home, and read it in the evenings while drinking malbec and eating peppered jerky and romano cheese, because food like this is mentioned so much in this book that you find yourself craving it like a heroine addict.<br/><br/>And I developed a bit of a habit. Now I’ve read three complete trilogies by Robin Hobb, and two of those trilogies I have actually re-read; I got my wife and my mother into it and we have read them all together as a group and discussed every week for a few years now.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way I discovered that Robin Hobb was a pseudonym, and that Megan Lindholm was not only the author’s real name, but also, Megan Lindholm was a name that she had written several other novels under in a distinct voice. I became intrigued to hear this distinct voice, but years went by, I was busy, and I never got around to it.<br/><br/>Until this year. For some reason, although I have always been a skinflint with buying the cheapest possible books, I found myself actually in a place where, as just one act of self-care for my own mental health, I started to actually spend a little bit of money on myself. Primarily through buying very nice copies of the Fitz and the Fool trilogy, but also, this nice 35th anniversary edition of Wizard of the Pigeons. For after all, this is the original break-out book Megan Lindholm, and she’s one of my favorite living authors. <br/><br/>How different this is, and yet the same. Right from the first page I was drawn in. She writes in the style of a fairy tale, but it’s also very specific to the city of Seattle; like James Joyce said of the book Ulysses, if Dublin (or in this case, Seattle) disappeared from the face of the earth, it could be re-created block by block with the detail in this book. I learned a lot about the Free Ride Area and the King Dome. And the sidewalks, oh the sidewalks…they used to be a whole story above ground, you know…<br/><br/>I also read this because of the premise: a homeless man on the streets is actually a modern street wizard, a type of wizard which Megan is creating out of whole cloth—in fact, I have seen this book cited as the prime precursor of the urban fantasy genre. How cool is that? But back to the book.<br/><br/>Our protagonist—a Viet Nam vet named Wizard—is not the only wizard in his world. He and the other street wizards follow a similar pattern: they each have unique powers and each have unique rules in order for their magic to work.<br/><br/>Wizard’s particular gifts are endearing. Inspiring, even. I really love them. He has a gift of Knowing the inner truth that people need to hear. People are drawn to him, strangers, who come to him and pour out their hearts to him, and then he Knows the Truth that they need to hear, says it to them, and if they receive it, it changes the whole trajectory of their lives. This concept alone made the book worth gold to me.<br/><br/>But Wizard is a difficult character to be the protagonist of a whole book. He’s a laconic character, silent and stubborn, immovable as a brick wall seemingly. He exhibits signs of depression and PTSD, and he is sometimes maddeningly silent. Yet for all this, the story good enough with pacing and plot and description that it still worked for me.<br/><br/>Something interesting to see in this book is that Robin Hobb’s knack for writing compelling characters is at work here. Here she has several very distinct, compelling characters. But they aren’t as developed over several books as she did later. It’s neat to see her craft being germinated here. It’s also neat to see her real-life compassion for the homeless (which you can learn about if you read her blog) shining through.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>The main conflict of the book is centered around Wizard losing his magic when a romantic interest shows up, Lynda, who starts basically taking over his life, and he starts to break his rules. He loses the magic more and more until it seems that he is irrevocably lost. <br/><br/>But then he meets with the other wizards again, one in particular who has been his mentor. And she says some things that really resonated with me at a level that transcends the story. Although I wonder if these will make sense out of context, I wanted to try to bring the magic of this book to you through sharing some of them here.<br/><br/>“You invented those [rules] yourself, knowing you couldn’t keep them. You wanted to break yourself so the magic would go away, so you wouldn’t be a wizard and have a duty to it. But even in your desire to be free of it, the magic went to deep in you for you to destroy it…you made up your own rules to break.”<br/><br/>“Stop pretending that you’ve been pretending.”<br/><br/>“She believed all the old myths: Men have no feelings such as women harbor; they can share your home, your bed, and your money, but not your life. She knew all about ‘how men are,’ but she had never really spoken to one. She wasn’t going to let him get through.”<br/></spoiler><br/><br/>So, enough said. This book is iconic, a legend. Read it, if you must. Or try to resist, if you dare. Perhaps though, the more you run from it, the more inevitable it will become.",,,1,0

I love this. Starting with the first page.<br/><br/>The forward to this is magnificently delicious. This is horror done right, you don't even realize it's horror, but it's setting you up with a growing mystery & a growing sense of unease/dread in the style of realism, which makes it all the more compelling. He's written this forward like a memoir. It's the classic ""I found this mysterious book"" setup, but by far the best execution I have ever seen, bar none.<br/><br/>It is its own stand-alone story, the characters are vivid, the subject matter (his wildly intelligent and divergent brother going missing), everything about it is compelling. I enjoy reading about wildly intelligent, divergent thinkers. There’s a charm to the concept. Probably makes me feel better about my ADHD! By the time it got to the end of the foreward, it was pitch perfect, and had me on the edge of my seat begging to read more; it was hard to stop listening at that point, but I had gotten to work and I needed to go in and start my day, damn it!<br/><br/>As I progressed, this book continued to be really rewarding. The author does a great job of giving us continual new pieces of information so you get to feel like you’re really learning something and progressing (a lot of mystery novels I have read fall into the trap of not revealing enough). He also has done some really unique worldbuilding that is really interesting to explore. The tension continues to heighten and there is violence and a bit of macabre gore, although I wouldn’t say this ever becomes a full on horror book, more just a thriller.<br/><br/>The great thing is that in between all of these tense moments of action there is a lot of deep pondering, there is more backstory to the main character and his relationships constantly revealed, and the other characters also come more to life. This book is the full package.<br/><br/>The ending is for me not satisfying. Well, it’s satisfying in the sense of yes, you learn about the mystery of the mountain and you have a very definitive ending and several mysteries are resolved, the worldbuilding is revealed, etc. However, the main message is not satisfying to me.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>The main message is essentially that, in the face of God (whoever or whatever that may be), but in the face of the fact that we don’t really have free will, that reality itself is a box that we are trapped in, and that even moments of transcendence or still pre-scripted for us and are essentially just us moving up to a bigger box…in the face of the colossal weight of realizing you have free will, what can you do? Well the answer given here is the same as Fight Club and many other stories. The ultimate “fuck you” to God or the universe or whatever is suicide: you can choose to remove yourself from reality altogether.<br/></spoiler><br/><br/>I have had the same thoughts and struggles with free will and God and been tempted to react in the exact same way, but ultimately, I have come to believe that my thinking was warped. I believe it comes out of my need to control life: like a toddler throwing a tantrum, if I can’t control the rules of the game, then I’m not going to play!<br/><br/>When I was writing this review I started by trying to explain all of life history around that question and how I arrived at that conclusion, and then I realized this would be waaaay too much for a review of a book. So I won’t really explain more than that for now. <br/><br/>Back to this book: it does one of the most important things for me as a reader: it gets me thinking about deeper questions and seeking for how to work them out in my own life.<br/><br/>Regardless of me agreeing with the authors apparent conclusion, this book still is a great book because it stimulates those musings and hopefully that turns into discussions with others and greater clarity. And the book gets you there in a riveting, engaging, novel way. I heartily recommend to is book to anyone, so long as thrillers don’t disturb your peace too much.",,,1,0

The story is told from the perspective of being whose exact nature is never explicitly explained. Klara is an AF, which I am guessing is short for android friend, and her purpose is to be a good companion to a child. A child's parents are away at work all day and the child doesn't interact with peers much as they are educated online. The child gets lonely. Solution: an AF.<br/><br/>Klara has a body that is similar to a human body but is clearly artificial. She has a mind that works similarly to a human's but not exactly the same. She is programmed to always be polite and kind and helpful. At first glance you might think that she would be a boring protagonist who wouldn't take any initiatives on her own--but that's not the case.<br/><br/>For starters, Klara has an interesting personal religion centered around the Sun. She recharges with solar, so she has an inbuilt desire to be in sunlight if possible. Throughout the book, in pretty much every scene, Klara notes what the Sun is doing. She heavily personifies the Sun, referring to it as ""he,"" and has conversations with it, and believes it can do miraculous things. In short she believes that it is God. And she bargains with God for certain important things that she needs throughout the novel. It's very interesting.<br/><br/>I feel like I finally read the first thing in a while that was truly original, a truly unique perspective, and it also was done really well. I'm so glad I read this and think I will look forward to re-reading it over the years. It says a lot about religion, free will, what makes someone a human, etc.<br/><br/>I will also mention, I'm so glad that I give authors second chances. The first thing I tried to read by Kazuo Ishiguro was a DNF for me, and I don't DNF hardly anything! I found Never Let Me Go to be positively boring. I'm so glad that I didn't let that taint my decision process and that I gave Ishi a second chance, because this is one of the best things I've read this year!",,,1,0

It was so cool to have that experience reading this.<br/><br/>This book is about a crew of diverse backgrounds romps through space. It's all about forging friendships with the other--people of other cultures, religions, species, and even alternate life-forms. There is tension, but it is more often in the form of interpersonal drama rather than thrilling life-threatening conditions, although there are a few of those. If you're looking for combat in your sci-fi, you will find none of that here. This is not your action-packed shoot-em-up in space. Rather, this is something rarely seen in science fiction: a really close look at relational dynamics.<br/><br/>But most importantly to me, this book asks questions like: could an AI become a human? Become loved? What if people figured out a way to transfer AIs that were previously body-less to physical bodies? Should they get rights? It also asks a lot of questions about what social norms are ""normal,"" and imagines a variety of other species in the galaxy that are reptilian, amphibian, chittinous, or even something without any analog on earth at all, and imagines how they might see the world through different eyes. These are all really great ways of challenging current societal norms around personal space, sex, relationships, how we do community, boundaries, and so much more.<br/><br/>I'm so thankful that Becky Chambers wrote this book, and look forward to reading more.",,,1,0

The Matrix, Android Netrunner, and many other things heavily borrowed a lot of conceptual ground from Neuromancer.<br/><br/>What’s not good is the heavy exposition, explaining how everything works, the insane amounts of technobabble, and just that it’s almost impossible to follow at times. Honestly it’s amazing that as many people read this as did. It would get absolutely nowhere in today’s market. Sometimes it was an absolute chore to read. This is the first time I’ve found myself having to lookup cliffs notes and sites like that to help me keep track of what’s going on in a scifi novel. This book reminds me of the style of some of the hard scifi in the 50s…it’s halfway between that and the poetic language of someone like Ray Bradbury, but also with the deep deep worldbuilding of Neal Stephenson, but even harder to follow than him. Maybe it didn’t help that I was listening on audiobook. If I did it all over I would do a hard copy for sure.<br/><br/>It’s hard to know how to rate this book. I loved the worldbuilding but I didn’t really love the experience of reading it as a whole. I understand that this was a pivotal moment for birthing cyberpunk. However, the author didn’t coin the phrase, didn’t affiliate himself with it, and probably honestly didn’t really love the movement that was birthed following his famous book. Also, the afterward written by a friend of Gibsons didn’t really help; wow that guy is pretentious. I hope Gibson isn’t as bad; I haven’t researched him well enough to know though.<br/><br/>For these reasons and more, I personally wonder whether Neuromancer being published was really necessary for the movement to be birthed; I view it as more inevitable. Scifi had for a long time been begging for an exploration of the different ways tech could affect augmenting humans and all the identity and societal implications that are inherently really fascinating.<br/><br/>Either way I’m grateful that the book exists and inspired a lot of people. I don’t want to hate on it at all but just thank it for being there, but also respectfully say…I’m glad that scifi has progressed since then.",,,1,0

It's a good fundamental truth that explains a lot of mysteries in the business world as well as life in general. It makes sense on so many levels and it's really, really, incredibly helpful for orienting you towards what is meaningful in life, staying aligned to your North star, and achieving long-term success instead of just short-term results. I'm really glad I read this book and I hope I continue to start with my why for the rest of my life. So in short, yes, I have drunk the kool-aid alllll the way. But I really do believe in this concept, from a philosophical perspective. If I'm not doing things that align with my passion, with my ""why"", with what matters most to me--then there's really no point in living at all. And I mean that quite literally. Being a walking zombie is even worse than being dead, it really is. So.

One reason that it's a great place to start is that this is written by the defector themself, not a journalist or someone else. Another reason is that Hyeonseo had such a variety of experiences living in NK, living in China, living in SK, and in escaping from several situations in her own story as well as helping others do the same, interacting with all kinds of different individuals and groups involved in every part of that world. And on top of that, so much of it is written in such a way that I was riveted, on the edge of my seat. She also seems to have a general understanding of the Western mindset, so she's able to explain cultural things in a way that is very illuminating, but without ever coming across as condescending or anything. She's just a great story-teller, a great teacher, and a person with such a life story that really needs to be told. I heartily recommend that anyone read this book.",,,1,0

But I have to say.<br/><br/>Imagine you’re talking to a friend that tells you gritty, scary war stories, a bit fantastic sometimes, but he constantly tries to convince you through every nook and crook and persuasive technique known to man that this story is REAL man, it really is real…you kind of nod along and try to believe him, but the stories are just too…well, they’re too well-crafted to be real. If you’ve read enough literature and told enough true stories and compared the two, well, you just know that there’s a huge difference in so many ways. The only way you could truly conceal the difference between a true story and a not-true story is if it was really short. Like, a few lines, tops. Once you’re a page or two in, the clues accumulate, until you Just Know.<br/><br/>But this friend, he knows all of that, and he says yes I know all of that, but that’s just the thing is, sometimes in REAL LIFE things really DO happen like that, and no one will believe you, but it really DOES. This REALLY DID happen, man.<br/><br/>So you go, ok, fine, whatever, maybe your’e telling me the truth. Just go ahead with your story already.<br/><br/>Cool, he says. So he tells you his story—which gets even more fantastic—and then at the end he says, by the way, everything I just told you is BS, none of that happened.<br/><br/>Then he proceeds to tell you another story that REALLY IS TRUE, MAN, and the cycle continues.<br/><br/>When you get to 2/3 of the way through this friend’s collection of stories, he finally comes clean with you and explains (in the chapter titled Good Form) a few things. First, nothing in this whole book really “happened.” Second, bad things did happen to him in Vietnam. But the problem is, all of the actual events that happened to him are foggy and hard to pin down and he can’t write a story about them that gets at the Story Truth. He delineates between Story Truth and Happening Truth and explains why he thinks it’s more worthwhile to go after Story Truth and to hell with what “actually happened.” <br/><br/>And the thing is, I agree with him. I’ve talked about this many times with others.<br/><br/>In fact, I love that he wrote that chapter. I wish everyone who’s interested in reading, and especially those interested in writing, would read it. It’s really helpful and cuts through the crap quickly and I believe him.<br/><br/>However, it took you 2/3 of the way through the book to get to that point. I wish he would have put it at the beginning. For me at least, personally, then I wouldn’t have had to combat this constant feeling of someone trying to get one over on me and then, just when they finally get me to concede that maybe I could believe them, they go HA—got you.<br/><br/>I think that my reaction reveals more about myself than the other, probably. Maybe. I don’t know. But I’m willing to assume that.<br/><br/>Perhaps the author wanted to put me through the trials of being lied to and trying to figure out what is true because that’s a recurring theme in his stories, he has tried to do that personally when talking to other soldiers as they tell their stories, etc. And the thing is, I can see how he played to his theme and everything.<br/><br/>And I like his stories. The titular first story is a classic that probably a million people have read, and rightfully so. I love it. And there are many other great stories in here, not “just another” war story, but each one kind of more than that. And there are a lot of great stories on truth, writing, etc.<br/><br/>But I’m still pissed about him fooling me.",,,1,1

I was looking for a quick overview of the French Revolution and this, at only 4 hours long, was a great find for me to prep me for diving into a longer, more comprehensive read. I find that reading something shorter, almost a summary, of a work helps me prepare for reading the work itself so that I comprehend more. This did that. I now feel pretty well equipped with very general, broad-strokes knowledge of the French Revolution.<br/><br/>Most chapters are on a particular person, like Robespierre or King Louis or countless other notable revolutionaries. There are a couple of important nobles but not so many of them.  A few chapters are on particular events, like the Reign of Terror or the Storming of the Bastille. And a few chapters are on groups, like the Girondins, the Montagnards, the Sans Culottes, etc. As such there is some overlap in the tellings of each thing: you can’t talk about the Reign of Terror without talking about Robespierre, etc. But for me this only helped to reinforce the learning. More repetitions means I’m actually learning it.<br/><br/>Of course, what’s lacking from this is any sense of strong dramatic narrative. The topics are laid out in roughly chronological order, and certain important people and events are placed next to each other, etc. So that helps. I think that for the format given (having chapters that are strictly topical), it was done about as well as could be reasonably expected. But it certainly doesn’t make you feel as much as a good narrative historian will.<br/><br/>It does a good job of trying to provide a succinct view of controversial events/people while still giving a little balance to them, explaining their detractors and protractors a little, but of course there is always the sense that the story goes so much deeper. But that can be forgiven as the great strength of this little book is that it covers so much ground in so little time. Excellent primer.",,,1,0

This is a re-telling of Cinderella, but several of the details have been changed around, so don't expect it to be the exact same. I think a lot of people would be disappointed that <spoiler>it doesn't end with her marrying the prince.</spoiler><br/><br/>Two major tweaks to the Cinderella story: 1) she's a cyborg (duh). 2) this is much more feminist. Cinderella isn't just waiting around for other people to do things; she has a job and skills and takes initiative on her own; she isn't waiting for anyone to rescue her. I enjoyed both of these tweaks.<br/><br/>There's lots of cyberpunk-mechanic vibe which I enjoyed.<br/><br/>There's a plot twist that you can predict from basically the beginning of the book.<br/><br/>And there's the problem that the politics plot in this world feels like it was dreamed up by a ten year old who knows nothing about real politics. The novel takes place in New Beijing, the capital of one of earth's kingdoms. The lunar queen is visiting. She and her guards act with impunity in the royal court, killing people and mind-controlling crowds and having basically just perfect control of whatever they want. The prince stands by helplessly and does he have his own guards? No, somehow in his own court and his own city he has no guards, no military power, he's completely out of control. none of this makes any sense. If the lunars are so powerful then why would an earth ""emperor"" allow them to visit earth? And why would they take -100 precautions against them?<br/><br/>The ending also felt completely out of left field. <spoiler>Why in the world does going to Africa make any sense as a means of Cinder retaking her lunar kingdom....??? Also how does that satisfyingly resolve anything?</spoiler><br/><br/>I still enjoyed reading most of this, but the botched ending is hard to get past.",,,1,0

Very much a comfort read. But also scifi because there’s a robot and new religions and stuff.<br/><br/>It’s a contemplative book that’s meant for the millennial generation. Not bad. I certainly enjoyed some passages. My main criticism is that there’s nothing vaguely monkish about this monk. Unless their idea of monks is very different from ours, which would be fine, but if so then their religion should be explained a little bit because as it is there’s no explanation of what exactly their religion is supposed to be about. Which is too bad because there’s intriguing elements. It’s polytheistic. But we never go deep into it.<br/><br/>The best parts of this are when they’re exploring through casual conversation the differences between organic consciousness and artificial consciousness. The robot culture is by far the most interesting thing.",,,1,0

Work really hard and don’t take no for an answer. Which really is a message that applies to sales but is far from universal. As an engineer being like that wouldn’t really help you.<br/><br/>In fact the protagonist consistently shows a lack of any good judgment. I don’t want to live my life like that nor would I want to employ someone who blindly follows directions even when it clearly leads down a ridiculous path. First off, the boss told him that the cost of the blue vase was negligible. When he found out that it cost $2,000 the response of anyone with good judgment would be: oh, clearly this either isn’t the case my boss wanted, or else he didn’t know how much it cost. Either way I should STOP and reconsider. <br/><br/>There are several other examples of bad judgment throughout the story. You could say that I’m missing the point of the story which is that perseverance really matters more than anything. I would say no…perseverance definitely matters a lot…but it doesn’t matter more than anything. Perseverance without good judgment, wisdom, skill, talents, intelligence, creativity …lots of other things…is not really a good thing in fact it’s a bad combo. <br/><br/>So really the only value of this book is pointing out that perseverance matters, but it does this so poorly I can’t really recommend it.",,,1,0

We have quickly gone from where there was almost no M/M and F/F relationships in mainstream books, to today, where we have books where almost every romantic relationship in the whole book is not heterosexual.<br/><br/>This book is interesting, slow, more focused on character development than plot. It is about a traveling spaceship captain, Nia Imani, who adopts a boy. There are overtones about empires exploiting people. There are some interesting concepts about FTL travel, but this is not a hard SF book; it's quite soft but still interesting from a literary perspective.<br/><br/>There is a host of characters, most of them crew members of the ship, and the cast includes a lot of strong females and not really any strong males. It is a bit noticeable. We're in this interesting place culturally where we have reacted so strong against traditional masculinity and traditional romantic relationships that now everything has to be NOT that. Someday I'm sure the pendulum will swing back but that seems to be where we are now. Anyways, moving back to the book.<br/><br/>There's this interesting boy who crash-lands (alone, naked, not in a spaceship) on a particular planet, and they have to figure out what to do with him. That's the opening situation of the main plot. This boy doesn't talk at all for a long time, and it quickly becomes clear that he's suffered a lot of trauma in his past. This sets the tone for the book: this is a serious story that involves a lot of sad things. This is not a light fluffy read where everyone gets married happily forever after in the end. But it is a serious, contemplative read with characters who grow and change and affect each other, and there is a lot of genuine beauty in the sad parts. I don't want to say more about the sad parts to spoil what happens, but it's done very well. This is a good book.<br/><br/>The downside is it's a bit slow. This is a character book. But this is a character book full of characters that are likable.",,,1,0

The narrator on the audiobook is very good. The First Nations accent is evocative and clear. Wonderful job on that front. Also, I really enjoyed the setting. I would love to hear a good story told of a post-apocalyptic period on a rez. More Native American stories would be welcome in general, but especially in this context, it seems fitting. I appreciate that idea.<br/><br/>However, after getting 30% of the way through this (2 hrs) and continually waiting for something to happen, I had to stop. Note, I push myself through a lot of books. But this one suffered from an egregious lack of anything happening. 2 hours into the book and only one plot point has happened: the services went out. Has anyone done anything meaningful about it? No. They’ve just noticed that the services are out and talked about it. A week into the outage, has a single person thought to drive outside of the rez and see what’s happening? No. They all just say, “well, let’s wait for the power to come back on. I’m sure it will eventually.” Fascinating. I feel that if a book can’t pull me in even slightly by the time I’m 30% through then, well—it’s just not going to.<br/><br/>Now, I don’t require that all books have a fast plot. Quite the contrary. But in the absence of a fast plot there must be something else to hold the attention. There needs to be interesting dialogue, or interesting character revelation, or interesting narration at least, or some poetry, something, anything—but unfortunately that’s not the case. <br/><br/>The book is almost entirely every-day narration of every-day events and every-day dialogue. The author seems to have fallen into the trap of thinking that everything that has to happen in a scene must be described. No, I don’t need to know that he walked to the phone, then picked up the receiver, and then put the receiver of the phone up to his ear and listened for a few moments, while standing there, hoping to hear a signal so that it would tell him if they still had landline service, but then he put the receiver down, discouraged that the line was dead. (Although I am hyperbolizing here.)<br/><br/>I try to judge a book by what it was trying to do. The desciption of this book includes the words “thriller” and “literary”. After 2 hrs of listening to this, I think I can definitively say, this is not a thriller. If no fear or horror or even action has happened whatsoever in the first 2 hrs—it’s not a thriller. I hope we can all agree on that.<br/><br/>On the term “literary,” that is much more subjective. One of the definitions of “literary” is that it is character-driven instead of plot-driven. While I can agree that it’s certainly not plot-driven, being character-driven is not merely an absence of being plot-driven. The characters are not revealed or developed in deep ways. Sure there are little things here and there, but no more character development/revelation than your average genre fiction, to be honest. We aren’t given hardly any insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters at all.<br/><br/>Another definition of “literary” is that it involves the human condition. This is even more subjective, and to anyone who disagrees I would fully respect that disagreement, but for me at least, I did not feel that this was seriously discussing the human condition. There simply wasn’t much being revealed about the characters besides their simple outward actions, which were by-and-large not actions other than any generic person might take.<br/><br/>So for me at least, I felt duped by the promises of this novel—1) thriller, and 2) literary—and cannot recommend it.",,,1,0

I guess I wish there was more in this book about the aliens and maybe the war. It feels like not much interesting happens with most of the Eight Antidote subplot, except at the end. And the scenes on Lsel Station are also mostly empty of much happening. Also, like half of the book is filler stuff where a short scene is drawn out really long with lots of inner thoughts about very tangentially related stuff that’s already been rehashed to death, with the person thinking ""I know this doesn't matter right now, but I'm going to think about all this other stuff right now anyways."" And there's just a lot of repitition that waters it down.<br/><br/>With that said, this still has the same beautiful style as the first book, the same kinds of interesting poetry and more of the interesting worldbuilding. The aliens are interesting and exploring the variations of collective thinking is interesting. <spoiler>Also there's a love story developing between the two main female characters.</spoiler> Content warning--most of this book is not sexual but there is one scene that is pretty explicit.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it for the most part. It's just that by the time I was halfway through I found myself skimming and skipping lots of sentences where I already knew what it was going to say before it said it and I wanted the book to stop wasting my time on that. I feel like if this book was just trimmed down to 2/3 the length it would have been perfect.",,,1,0

George is the rational man, who is trying to do the right thing, trying to take care of the physical man, but the body has physical needs and is overwhelmed by feelings: fear drives it to do terrible things, after which it feels shame and guilt, but is unable to remember the bigger picture and stop from repeating the same habits again and again. Of course if you apply this analogy to the story then George having to kill Lenny is a pretty dark message, which I wouldn't endorse. But it's an interesting extra lens to view the story through.</spoiler><br/><br/>This book is really short, and if you haven't read it--and especially if you haven't read anything by John Steinbeck, this is a must read. I love Grapes of Wrath. But whereas that is 500 pages, this is 100 pages. It's so short that you might as well just read it. It's very sad and powerful and deep.",,,1,0

11422,Redeeming Love,Francine  Rivers,"Rivers, Francine",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.51,Multnomah,Paperback,479,2007,1991,2021/04/23,2020/07/03,,,read,"I try to semi-regularly engage in reading outside of my normal genres. This being a Christian romance novel, it was clearly outside the norm for me. I almost never read romance and I only read select Christian novels. But my wife's favorite author is Francine Rivers, so I decided I needed to find out what it was about.<br/><br/>This is also kind of in the historical fiction category. It's in California during the Gold Rush and the time period when fires devastated San Francisco on a regular basis. I found the historical backdrop mildly interesting, but I wouldn't say the worldbuilding was necessarily the richest or deepest. It was of moderate depth.<br/><br/>Where this book really shines is the story itself. If you're familiar with the book of Hosea (God tells a prophet to marry a prostitute and keep re-buying her when she returns to prostitution) and you think you would enjoy a more modern retelling of that story, then you will probably like this book. The style and prose and character development are all fine, pretty standard stuff. Nothing terrible, but also nothing extraordinary. They don't get in the way. What really shines is just the power of this story. Right at the beginning of the main story I was intrigued by the opening setup: a stone-faced prostitute takes daily walks. A farmer is visiting town and hears God clearly tell him to pursue her and marry her. He is taken completely aback and thinks that cannot be. But God's voice is clear. Ok...what is he going to do? What are all the implications of this? What is everyone going to say? How is he going to go about getting through to her? Etc.<br/><br/>Before the main story, we are given Angel's backstory as a child, showing what happened to her mother, how her mother went from adultery to prostitution, what it was like for a little girl growing up with a mother who is a woman of the night, and what happened to her after her mother died. It's heartbreaking and it feels pretty realistic. Speaking of which, I felt that this book treated the subject matter (prostitution, including the thinking of the prostitute and everyone else who interacts with prostitutes) pretty realistically. I was pleasantly surprised by this. Most Christian books, I think, would really write about this in a manner betraying just how little the author knew. This book did not reek of that at all.<br/><br/>In fact it accurately (in my humble opinion) portrays just how long it would take someone like that to change their worldview. As this man woos her and tries to show her a different way of engaging in relationships with other people, she is stubbornly resistant, and this makes sense. I'm actually glad that the story took as long as it did for Angel to slowly change how she viewed herself and her ability to trust others and engage in a spiritual life. I haven't personally recovered specifically from being a prostitute, but I have recovered from my own deep-seated issues and worked with friends of all kinds, recovering from addiction, trauma, etc. And it takes a few years of hard work for your brain to change about deep, meaningful things. It is so cheap and unrealistic when novels pretend like these things can just be fixed with a snap of the wand. Psychological/spiritual/mental problems take a lot of practice and failure in order to work through. This book portrayed that reality. I can imagine how some readers would have been put off by that but I for one really appreciate it.<br/><br/>This book did a good job of showing the inner thoughts of several different characters. I felt it could have given Michael (the man who marries Angel) a flaw or two. (No, I don't consider having a slight temper when really provoked to be a real ""flaw"".) And I was annoyed by some of the other things in here that I recognize are simply the expected tropes of romance, but annoy me nonetheless: women staring longingly at men swinging axes with broad strokes, going on and on about how perfectly handsome they are, yada yada. Michael is, of course, perfectly handsome in every way. No flaws. Oh and he beats up five dudes in a tavern who are bigger than him, without any given reason why he would be able to do that. Ok. Fantasy. And yes, the epilogue is one of those where every character gets a happy ending with a bow on top. But these things were minor annoyances to me, just surface problems, not really deep problems with the story or anything.<br/><br/>There's also a pretty interesting side story that develops later on with two of the other characters. I won't say anything more about it besides that it has to do with the book of Ruth and it was a pleasant and interesting side story, kind of an alternate love story to the main one being played out.<br/><br/>I also like that after halfway through the story, it changes from the dynamic being just the two of them (Michael and Angel) to having a small community around them. I think that was really important to fleshing out this kind of story into a more full picture. Inner change doesn't happen in a vacuum, it happens largely in the interaction with one's community.<br/><br/>Ok, so final verdict: this is a really powerful story. It is the true Gospel told in a realistic, compelling manner. If you're a literary reader, this isn't necessarily going to appeal to your brain as much, but it also doesn't do anything really bad to get in the way. Your'e reading it for the main plot and for the idea of putting yourself in this situation. That's the way I read it at least and I thought it was very worthwhile.<br/><br/>I will also mention the narrator on the audiobook was good. There was also a 10 minute interview with the author at the end of the book--well worth listening to to hear where the author was coming from in writing this. I am thankful to Francine Rivers for writing something that so profoundly impacted her personally. A lot of times it's those books that end up making the biggest impact, and I'd say that is self-evident in this instance. This is her most popular book by far, and is being made into a movie in 2021. I encourage anyone who can enjoy Christian fiction to check it out. I also recommend it for people interested in Christianity who want to know what real Christianity (actually living by the teachings of Jesus) can look like.",,,1,0

A few pointers: <br/>1. Everyone in space goes mad. There is no reason for this, it’s just, you know—spaaaaaaace. <br/>2. When people go mad, they get really philosophical. Cause, you know, that’s what everyone does when they go mad.<br/>3. Speaking of which, people in the future have lost the ability to think and act in a halfway reasonable way, especially when their life is at risk. Or someone else’s. Why would we not do suicidal things? Spaaaaaace.<br/>4. You might think that futuristics societies with affordable rocket ships and time travel machines and dome cities on Venus would mean they have things like alcohol and cigars (spoiler: they have to travel back in time to get those). Or that they would have hats to keep off the rains of Venus when they land there and have to treck for days through the jungle (nope: hats not invented yet). Or better yet, the ability to land their rocket ship next to a city instead of in the middle of nowhere. No, they don’t have any of those things.<br/>5. There are no space ships—only rocket ships.<br/>6. There is no difference at all between Earth and the other planets. They are virtually the same in every way. They all have trees and breathable air and people who live there already. Why would they be any different than Earth??<br/>7. You’d better get used to using landline telephones and phonographs if you want to survive in the future.<br/>8. And old-fashioned sexism. There’s a dab of that here and there too.<br/>9. Nobody is happy in the future. They’re either discontent that they live in a house that makes everything for them, or discontent that they’re in space instead of home, or discontent that they’re at home instead of space. Or the one guy who’s traveling back and forth between home and space is alternately discontent in a different way in each place. Or you’re a martian, and you invade Earth, and it’s so nice that…that makes you discontent too? Sure. There are no exceptions. Everybody needs to be discontent and mad.<br/><br/>Some of the stories towards the end I actually liked quite a bit, but unfortunately, the majority of the stories are monotonous. They’re just about malaise/discontent/madness in space/another planet/earth.<br/><br/>And unfortunately there are lots of non-starter premises. The same company that invents time travel machines has a problem on their hands when people don’t come back from their vacation. Which totally makes sense, since it’s not like they can master time…and have people come back to right when they left…nope. <br/><br/>Or another premise: it turns out that as the works of famous authors are burned on Earth, at some point that author shows up on Mars and begins to have a state of suffering as his works are burned. But when the last work is burned then the author dies. Wait, what exactly made them appear on Mars? Who knows, we don’t need to explore that. Also, it’s stated that when humans step onto Mars, that will drive them to Jupiter. Wait, how does this work? How do they know this? “Silence,” says Ray, “No one needs to ask questions like that here. The characters just know.”<br/><br/>These stories make the most sense if you look at them as surrealism. I think you’re not supposed to really question how things came to be up until the beginning of the story or how the story makes sense in a coherent universe. Unfortunately for me, Bradbury’s flavor of surrealism just never sat well with me. Maybe it would for others though.<br/><br/>Also, I will say, Bradberry has a unique way of handling the problem of when to challenge reader expectations: he just doesn’t. Or another way of handling explaining strange premises: again, just don’t. Everyone on earth has the same dream one night of the world ending. Why? Dunno, don’t care. How? Dunno, don’t care. Instead let’s just focus intently on the characters doing the same thing that they do every night. Because that’s exactly what people would do if the world was ending…? In fact, that’s the very last thing.<br/><br/>And that brings me to another big problem I have with Bradbury’s stories. The characters don’t make sense. They just don’t act like real people that I know. Their rationale is flimsy, very transparently invented to fit the mood the author wants to portray with the story, which is, unfortunately, always the same mood: “future” malaise. Some future malaise can be great on a story if it’s implemented right and isn’t spread out over every single story. But this?<br/><br/>Having read Fahrenheit 451 and loved it, I was hoping for more of the same love to be fulfilled here. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It did have a lot of the same poetic description and capturing certain moods and using beautiful allegories, but in the stories I disliked, these were all so over-done that it was sickening. I really wanted to like this. It’s really too bad. His style was so perfectly balanced in 451. Oh well. Maybe I can still find something else he’s written that is better than this.<br/><br/>Another kicker was to realize that most of these stories aren’t really science fiction. A handful are just straight-up fantasy, nothing science fiction about them. And many of them were only science fiction on façade, not really. They premises often had little to do with any hard science. And mostly regarding things that I’m sure Ray must have been aware of in the 50s—he just didn’t care.<br/><br/>So, enough criticism. To end on a high note, I’ll summarize a few stories—all in the later half—that I did like.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>Marionettes, Inc: what if your wife was too cold toward you, or conversely, too smothering? If you had lived that way for 10 or 20 years, what might you do to escape? Would you pay $10,000 to Marionettes Incorporated to get a live facsimilie of yourself? And if you did…what might happen? If your marionette is just like you, it might have feelings and such…as well as free will to change the game up on you. This story was delightfully terrifying.<br/><br/>City: what if mankind has already been all over the universe and forgotten about it? What if we have already made enemies and they are waiting to take revenge on us? It’s an entire empty city that the earth-men discover and it is spooky as hell.<br/><br/>Zero Hour: Martians, hidding in underground tunnels all over Earth, are going to take over the world through our kids. Because kids have suspension of disbelief and because parents don’t take kids seriously, they can play at their “make-believe” game of invaiders—that actually isn’t make-believe—helping the Martians overthrow their parents so they can have later bedtimes and go to more movies on the weekends. This story was pretty funny.<br/><br/>Rocket: if you were a poor man with a large family and you were all sick for space, what lengths might you go to? What experience might you have in doing so? This has an ethical flair to it.<br/><br/></spoiler><br/><br/>Besides those, in the first half, Other Foot and Highway were alright. The other ten stories…not so much. I noticed that half of his stories that I liked were basically straight-up horror. So, is Ray Bradbury a talentless hack? No, I wouldn’t say that. I would say that I don’t like his style of surrealism but I do like his stories that aren’t that—his horror, his realism (which I would classify the Rocket as), and his humor. These stories are in the minority in this collection. But I might buy this book if it was on sale for the handful of stories that I did like. Oh well.",,,1,0

This reads like an origin story, but that didn’t hurt the story. This stood on its own perfectly well, for it doesn’t assume you know anything about Thrawn, and his actions, motivations, and psyche are revealed in a satisfying way. From the first page, he’s an intriguing character that makes you wonder: how do things work where he comes from? What are his real motivations for leaving where he's from and showing up in the Empire? What is he going to do next?<br/><br/>This book is a mix of action and psychological intrigue. Each chapter starts with a little prologue of Thrawn’s thoughts on a topic, usually relevant to the chapter you’re about to read. Most of these are pretty good. A military commander’s thoughts would not necessarily be of universal interest if they were always concerned with strategy and tactics minutia that only pertain to battlefields. But his thoughts are more interesting because they are concerned with human concerns that are universal, about alliances, the element of chance, knowing one’s enemy, how to be balanced in confidence, things like that. They are always applied to war but they are written such that they apply pretty well to all life. Kind of like reading Sun Tzu’s Art of War, but easier to read and more modern. And Western.<br/><br/>As for the plot itself, it’s interesting enough. It’s kind of like a rags-to-riches story, just substitute power for riches. He starts off at the bottom and climbs up the rungs of the Imperial Navy at a meteoric rate. Lots of people are pissed about this because he’s from the Unknown Regions (read: not in the “in” culture) and he’s not a human. So everyone's against him. It's satisfying to see someone rise up when lots of nasty people are trying to stop him.<br/><br/>Is this an antihero story? Yes and no. He is an enemy to the rebellion (at least, we know he will be...this story is written before there is a formal Rebel Alliance). He is trying to help the Empire in general...but there are exceptions to this that I can’t explain without spoilers. Also, he has a lot more nobility and less pettiness than everyone around him. So there are some likable traits here. This isn’t a pure evil character, not by any stretch of the imagination. He’s mostly concerned with keeping order and stability in the galaxy and keeping it from descending into chaos or barbarism.<br/><br/>There are two other characters whose lives we follow pretty closely as well. One is Cadet Vanto, who is a nobody from Wild Space who was planning on making his family proud by keeping a nice desk job in the Empire. All that gets up-ended when he is assigned to be Thrawn's translator, as he knows a rare language (Sy Bisti) that Thrawn also knows. The other character is Arihnda Pryce, whose story starts with her parents' small mining company getting taken over. The little back-water planet of Lothal is getting some attention from the Empire, and that's both good and bad. She goes to Coruscant and gets plunged into a world of intrigue, and she also has to climb up many rungs of power.<br/><br/>The world of Coruscant is fleshed out a bit, I like that. I hope to see more of that in future books. As far as the Unknown Regions, it's only alluded to, but I'm pretty sure we will learn more about that in future books as well.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain how good this is. It doesn't sound that exciting. Most of the excitement comes from the action sequences, mostly battles or run-ins with marauders or things like that. But the interactions between characters are also quite interesting. I could see there might be some--the type who just wants pure action non-stop--who would get a bit bored at this, but I don't think most people would. I certainly didn't.<br/><br/>Star Wars reads have been hit or miss. I love Star Wars but let's be honest: lots of the books have been mediocre. This, however, is not one of them.<br/><br/>Also, if you have a chance to listen to the audio version of this book, I highly recommend it. It has very high quality production value. You hear people chattering in the background at a space port, or hear a space battle happening in the background when there's a space battle...crowds, lifts, starfighter engines, everything. It's quite impressive. The voices are very energetic. Thrawn's voice is amazingly velvety, intriguing, soft, and yet...so intense. The only thing I would tweak is, the narrator gets too melodramatic sometimes with how he chooses to inflect ""intense"" parts. Like, just chill, dude, we're not kids. But that's really the only thing I could find to criticize.<br/><br/>You want to read this. ""Do it, and your transformation to the Dark Side will be complete."" Or not, that's cool too.",,,1,0

I intended to pick up the Captain's Daughter by Pushkin, and only when I got home from the library and started reading this did I stop and think--wait--for what reason did I put this in my queue? Upon realizing my mistake, I decided to go with it anyway and see what what random book that Lady Luck had chanced to give me.<br/><br/>My first impression was that the writing was pretty good, the character's voices were strong, but I didn't see why I should care about all these rich people. The opening scene was three moms sitting around while their kids played in the pool--definitely not the best way to start a compelling story. But the writing was good, so I decided to go a little further.<br/><br/>This isn't much of a spoiler, since this happens very soon at the beginning of the novel, but the precipitating event is that the protagonist's father, an old lonely lobsterman, is diagnosed with brain cancer. He's going to die soon.<br/><br/>As the book progressed, it became apparent that the main theme was really about someone feeling juxtaposed between two contrasting worlds: one of her childhood, one of adulthood. One rustic and working with her hands, the other pampered and surrounded by pretentious people. In both worlds she feels alternately like an insider or an outsider, like a native or a fake. That's pretty interesting.<br/><br/>There are also suplots all over the place with other characters and they're all fairly interesting. One of the strongest other subplots is a teenage girl who has gotten herself into trouble with a not-so-great boyfriend, and who ends up confiding in a stranger (the protagonist, Eliza) and getting help.<br/><br/>The style of this author is to constantly intersperse real-time events with memories and backstory. This could be annoying to some, but I was pretty comfortable with it in this book.<br/><br/>By the time I got halfway through the book, it actually became better and better--I didn't want to put it down at all. It became less about rich-people-problems and more about everyone-problems. And discovering some key insights into her parents and other people was also pretty riveting. Things click, and it all makes sense.<br/><br/>The ending was mixed for me--some parts of it were great, some parts put a bad taste in my mouth. It reverted back to the rich-people-problems thing for a little bit. <br/><br/>Overall, though, this was a very solid book, a nice blend, a well-mixed drink. I would easily recommend this to many people. It's definitely more oriented towards women, as most of the main characters are women. But personally I didn't feel turned off by that. Her dad is a character I really savored. Also, now I need to go eat some lobster. A lot of lobster. I remember how when I was in Maine, the McDonalds' had lobster mcMuffin. But I digress.

I would say the book succeeds at doing that pretty well. The characters are good and several of them have meaningful changes of whole plots devoted to their character arc. This is the novel’s strength.<br/><br/>I would say the weakness is the prose is rather plain. There are occasional poetic snippets but not much else. It’s a very direct style however that is easy to read, and I can see how this would be a good pick for middle school readers for example.<br/><br/>The setting details I found very apt and interesting and useful to the plot. <br/><br/>One problem is that at the end it leaves the main plot (or what I perceived to be the main plot) hanging without resolution. That seems a puzzling choice as that plot would definitely have a yes/no outcome, so why not reveal what that outcome was? I suppose the answer could be that that wasn’t the point. Still, it’s not satisfying for the reader.<br/><br/>The fear you feel for the characters is palpable throughout the book. There is so much waiting, knowing that at any time the antagonists could do something awful, and probably will, but what and when simply hang in the air like the Sword of Damocles.<br/><br/>It did leave me with a lingering feeling of depression, which is not necessarily a criticism of the work itself, but perhaps my personal reaction.<br/><br/>So overall: a very solid read. A “light” read in terms of style and readability, but not at all a light read in terms of emotions. This isn’t going to leave you with sunshine and rainbows in the end but there are glimmers of hope throughout. Basically, I recommend this to most anyone, with the caveat that you wouldn’t want to read it at a time you’re not feeling your best emotionally.",,,1,0

This is essentially historical fiction, where a modern woman, Dana--and sometimes her husband--travel back in time to early 1800s Maryland, on a slave plantation owned by one of her ancestors, Rufus. Every time Rufus is dying--which turns out to be several times throughout his life--she is teleported to him, apparently to help save him.<br/><br/>The first time, Rufus is a small boy and he seems innocent and she hopes that she can influence him to not turn out like his father. The story chronicles Rufus' growing up and changing gradually, and a lot of ethical questions that Dana faces. When should she stop saving him from dying? Is saving him different than killing him? What would justify killing him? If she helps him, is she enabling a slaveholder controlling his slaves, or is it better to try to influence him to be a better version of himself? <br/><br/>The scenarios that unfold are varied and seem naturally fitting. We get to experience, vicariously, so many different aspects of slavery as the story develops. Breeding, being sold, rape, denying education, all the forms of violent and non-violent control and manipulation, turning one's own people against each other, the role of religion, the role of the outside white community, the traveling patrols, the Underground Railroad, the deadliness and uncertainty of diseases back then...the list goes on.<br/><br/>I think this is an example of excellent historical fiction. It gives us a full gamut of the experiences of living back then. It also gives us a wide array of characters, black and white, and shows their different ways of handling all the vicissitudes of that life. The story has great sadness in parts, and that is the overall feeling I am left with at the end, but there is certainly some relief and good things that happen at the end as well. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this book to anyone with interest in the history of the pre-Civil War South. It's not bloated with too many details--there are just a few here and there as they are pertinent. It's very easy to read and engaging. Each chapter _matters_ in an urgent way. It's full of action and difficult conversations and difficult experiences. But it didn't feel depressing to me at all--just a bittersweet sadness and gladness.<br/><br/>I look forward to reading more of Octavia Butler's work.",,,1,0

There’s so many books; I can’t afford to waste time on reading subpar ones right? But this book came upon me differently than most. <br/><br/>I was frustrated that day, cut off in a town I didn’t want to be in with time I had to kill. I went into a Barnes & Noble, picked this up whimsically, and was suddenly entranced. The narrator felt so familiar to me on a personal level: his honest and open voice, his making fun of his overly sing-songy name, “Jedidiah Jenkins,” his addressing of Christianity in a way simultaneously joking and serious (I thought only I did that?), his wanderlust, and his bold-faced proclamation of loving Jesus (very unusual for modern books not sitting in the Christian section). <br/><br/>Normally, when I pick up a book whimsically, odds are I’m not going to love it. This time was one of two exceptions. (The other is Assassin’s Apprentice by Robin Hobb. It stood out because her last name was almost the same as mine. I had zero expectation that it would be good. It was.) But this book, right from the beginning, felt like it was by someone who spoke my personal languages. This passage entranced me at the very beginning of the book, The Itch:<br/><br/>“‘The youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or perchance a palace or temple on the earth, and at length the middle-aged man concludes to build a wood-shed with them.’ - Henry David Thoreau.<br/><br/>“I have learned this for certain: if discontent is your disease, travel is medicine. It resensitizes. It opens you up to see outside the patterns you follow. Because new places require new learning. It forces your childlike self back into action. When you are a kid, everything is new. You don’t know what’s under each rock, or up the creek. So, you look. You notice because you need to. The world is new. This, I believe, is why time moves so slowly as a child—why school days creep by and summer breaks stretch on. Your brain is paying attention to every second. It must as it learns the patterns of living. Every second has value.<br/><br/>“But as you get older, and the patterns become more obvious, time speeds up. Especially once you find your groove in the working world. The layout of your days becomes predictable, a routine, and once your brain reliably knows what’s next, it reclines and closes its eyes. Time pours through your hands like sand.<br/><br/>“This equation has a crummy side effect: while our child brains are absorbing the ways of the world…mislabeled patterns of survival get swept in as we grow. Bad examples. Wrong thinking. Mistaken assumptions. They get caught in the flow of time through adolescence and carried into adulthood, buried beneath everything else. You watch your dad fly into a rage while driving, and your little brain logs it away. You overhear your mom talking about hell, and something rearranges in your head. A building block placed so deep and quickly covered. We show up as adults, confused by our own thinking, and with time running out.<br/><br/>“But travel has a way of shaking the brain awake. When I’m in a new place, I don’t know what’s next even if I’ve read all the guidebooks and followed the instructions of my friends. I can’t know a smell until I’ve smelled it. I can’t know the feeling of a New York street until I’ve walked it. I can’t feel the hot exhaust of the bus by reading about it. I can’t understand the humility of walking beneath those giant buildings. I can’t smell the food stands and the cologne and the spilled coffee. Not until I go and know it in its wholeness. But once I do, that awakened brain I had as a kid, with wide eyes and hands touching everything, comes right back. This brains absorbs the new world with gusto. And on top of that, it observes itself. It watches the self and parses out old reasons and motives. The observation is wide. Healing is mixed in.”<br/><br/>Those last four sentences crystallized, for me, a concept I have wanted to say many times and had never found the words for. Until now. I love it when a book does that to me.<br/><br/>Ok, so what is this book? Plot-wise, a middle-aged man decides to bike from Oregon to Patagonia (tip of South America) in order to find himself and sort through what he believes. The theme is a search for meaning.<br/><br/>These concepts about himself are introduced early on in the book: 1) he went through life with passive decisions, following others, hiding himself. 2) he struggled a lot with how to live his life in a meaningful way, how to balance conflicting ideas like “do what you love” and “follow your passion.”<br/><br/>As his travel down south progresses, the following are also introduced: 1) he had experienced feeling gay since he was a small child, and needed to battle through what that means for someone who also believes in Jesus/Christianity, 2) he struggles with Christianity as a whole.<br/><br/>Re Christianity as a whole, he seems to be influenced a lot by his reading a book about the atrocities that the Spanish conquistadors wreaked on South & Central America. He also meets with a lot of different friends on the way who join him for different parts of his trip (or in one case, a stranger who bikes with him for much of the time). A lot of the changes in his thinking come from conversations with others.<br/><br/>When it came to him questioning his faith and finding new ideas, I was disappointed. The pivotal conversation with others (while ascending Machu Picchu) is so dumbed-down that it’s hard to take it seriously. Not that there aren’t some good points, but…if we’re going to talk about spirituality/religion, I was hoping for more depth. For instance, one of the major shifting points in his thinking is the idea that the Bible should conform to his experiences, rather than his experiences conforming to the Bible. He seems oblivious to what this is called or any of the nuances of it. He has stumbled onto the philosophy of secular humanism: that reality is defined by human beings’ experiences. Jed never explores at all whether there are any downsides to this philosophy. Of course, few people are even aware of the name as this philosophy is so dominant in modern Western culture that most people don’t realize it’s there: it’s as invisible as air. Still, I wished Jed would have really attempted to explore his questions of the faith in more detail. He could have read philosophy, apologetics, or the foundational texts of other religions. Or he could have at least tried to explore all the aspects of the philosophy that he and his friends were fleshing out. They never really take any time to flesh things out or try to come up with a coherent worldview; they just end up with a few different disjointed ideas. So, while I have no problem with people questioning their faith (in fact I think it’s essential; nor do I assume that people should come to all the same conclusions as I), I was left feeling empty and sad that there wasn’t more depth here, both for the sake of me the reader and Jed the person.<br/><br/>Likewise when it came to his sexuality, he never really got somewhere concrete with it. One moment he would act like he was totally going in one direction, and another moment he would go in the other. Okay, it’s fine to go back-and-forth on something a while, especially something so important to one’s inner psyche. But I was disappointed that he didn’t really seem to get anywhere with it by the end of 14,000 miles. <br/><br/>Something else I was halfway anticipating was a character arc where at the beginning, he starts off being wishy-washy with how he makes decisions, mainly following what he is told by others instead of figuring things out for himself, and by the end, he becomes the opposite. But that doesn’t really happen. It feels like the book makes these promises—as well as a promise that he’s going to really finally confront his mom—but these promises don’t materialize.<br/><br/>So, with those criticisms stated, does that mean I hated it? Actually no. The main reason is that he is so open and honest. I don’t dislike the narrator at all. In fact he sounds like the kind of guy I would enjoy sitting and having a beer or three with. I would probably enjoy travelling with him. I would enjoy talking with him about all these same issues he talks about in this book. I’m glad he wrote it and I’m glad I read it. Lacking in depth in a couple key areas? Yes. But it fulfilled in several other areas.<br/><br/>I love his descriptions of places and people wherever he travels. He shows people in a way that feels very unfiltered. It’s not always flattering. It feels like he tries to simply observe people as well as he can and write down the interesting truth about individuals. I myself would be afraid to write down the level of detail he did (would I offend them?) but I’d like to think I would stick to my guns and do it anyway. I’m really glad he did. It never felt like he was trying to slander anyone: just tell the truth as best he could.<br/><br/>Another area this excels in is showing his inner monologues, his self-doubts. They can be hilarious, and they are very human. Every time that he’s camping on some stranger’s land and someone approaches them, he thinks, “Oh shit. They’re going to run me off or kill me.” And then is usually surprised at what actually happens. He also gets into trouble with not having learned Spanish hardly at all before going down there. Throughout the book that’s a theme: he tends to not prepare for things, like, at all. I’m glad that he’s perfectly transparent about that and really just puts his weaknesses out there. I wished he would have grown in this area by the end of the story, but oh well, such is life. We don’t always grow in every area and it’s better that he wrote down the truth about himself rather than pretending like this trip made him into an ideal version of himself. Also, I kind of like that the story shows you don’t always have to be a paragon of preparedness to take on great things.<br/><br/>This book really appeals to my love of nature too. There are many serendipitous passages describing the deserts, the beaches, the ocean, the mountains, waterfalls, cliffs, and several species of animals that sound almost magical in their appearance.<br/><br/>In summary, would I recommend this? Yes. It is beautiful and it is honest and it is insightful in many ways, just not some of the ways I expected it to be.<br/><br/>I will close the review out with several of my favorite excerpts—some of the ones that work alright without much context. If you aren’t worried about spoilers, then read on and enjoy. May the journey be a rich one.<br/><br/>p35: “With the Internet connecting us all, the rest of the world feels closer, less alien. But I think that’s only true in our minds. The Internet does not bring Argentina one inch closer to me than before. That’s part of why I craved this trip. Knowledge alone is like an unearned memory, mostly forgotten.”<br/><br/>p43: “As we approached the Golden Gate Bridge, so did the fog. It pushed on and around the bridge like milk pouring into coffee, swirling and taking over. When we rode on the giant red structure, we could not see the water below. Only gray. Cars would appear out of nowhere and disappear behind us. It was cold. We stopped. We were out-of-body present, observing ourselves on the bridge, as if from outside.”<br/><br/>p186 he describes the experience of being on mushrooms and feeling so connected with nature in a full way that he hears a ladybug land on a blade of grass.<br/><br/>p208, talking about Mom making him go to church 3 times a week: “‘Train up a child in the way that he should go, and he will not depart from it. That’s what I’m doing.’ I thought, Oh, I’ll depart from it! Watch me! I resented church and I resented my mom for making me go. Years later she told me in passing, ‘I was a single mother of three kids, no money, no help, no time to myself. Church was the only safe place we could go where I knew you’d be looked after and taken care of. It was the only place I felt less alone in all of this.’ As a kid, it never dawned on me that my mother was overwhelmed or frighened or worried about the job she was doing. It never occurred to me that she had complex motives.”<br/><br/>p226: “‘Wow,’ Weston said, walking his bike. ‘I trusted that native woman with the weather, just because of how she looked. I thought she was a gift from God, like He brought her to us. I was lazy and just assumed she knew everything. And I had the worst night of my life [sleeping in the freezing rain]. And we were rescued by cops. Cops!’ He shook his head. ‘God’s favorite lesson is humility.’”<br/><br/>p233, quoting a poem by persian mustic Hafiz:<br/>“Even after all this time,<br/>The Sun never says to the Earth,<br/>you owe me,<br/>look what happens with a love like that,<br/>it lights the whole world.”<br/><br/>p284 - this one needs context to really explain. He has been learning more about the darker side of the United States’ history, particularly when it comes to foreign affairs, all of the puppet governments and US-backed terrorists, etc. But then he comes back to the opposing feelings, the antithesis, remembering how beautiful the States are. He merges thesis and antithesis in this beautiful simple statement said at the end of a long dialogue with an Argentinian mom who knows about all of the darkness but still wants to go to America someday. “‘I mean, I’ve always wanted to visit the US,’ she says, somewhat reassuringly. ‘I want to do a road trip across it. It’s so famous, to do the US road trip. One day I will. I want to see the empire before it falls.’ ‘It is a beautiful empire,’ I said.” <br/><br/>It sounds simple, but that one sentence sums up so much for me. Yes, it’s an empire. But…it is a beautiful empire.<br/>",,,1,0

31138556,Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,"Harari, Yuval Noah",,"=""""","=""""",3,4.19,Harper,ebook,450,2017,2015,2020/12/30,2020/12/03,,,read,"It's hard to know how to rate this. In this book, Harari starts off with some predictions that humans will try to achieve God status through several God-like powers that are being developed as we speak. Then he goes all the way back in time to the dawn of man and essentially summarizes history through a particular lense: that is, of world religions. These religions include not only conventional religions, but also includes socialism, capitalism, and three types of humanism: socialism, evolutionary humanism (eugenics), and liberalism. He then tries to predict the future religion, which he calls big-dataism. That is the book.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for grand themes and pulling many disparate studies together into grand theories and predictions. So I enjoyed the structure of the book. I like that he tries to predict the future through first understanding history as well as he can. Predictions based on data are not always necessarily right--no prediction necessarily is--but they're a lot better than people just shooting their mouth off based on their limited worldview. We have a much better perspective from trying to understand all of humanity in all time periods and places--that is, to get outside of ourselves. I'm a huge proponent of studying history to understand today.<br/><br/>When it comes to all of his conclusions and lenses, it's hard to generalize. Some I thought were insightful and accurate, and others I thought were entirely misguided. And many were in the middle: they seemed accurate but didn't necessarily provide fresh insight. <br/><br/>I would recommend this book, for there were multiple insightful ideas here for me and I would guess there would be multiple for most other people as well, although not necessarily the same ones. <br/><br/>Many of my disagreements with him, as you will see below, were around religion. He is an atheist and I am not. However, my disagreements with him did not ruin any usefulness of the book. It was still insightful from understanding history and predicting the future, for as he says, in the 21st century, where do you expect most of the world-changing advancements to come from? The religions of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism? Or from science and engineering? In the past they came from the former but in the 20th century they all came from the later, and we can expect that to continue. Hence we need to understand the underlying philosophies/religions of science in order to predict the future with any relevancy at all. It's my goal to understand these and he has helped me do so. I don't hold it against him personally that he disagrees with me about the existence of God, nor does that disagreement in-and-of-itself make this a bad book, although it's certainly tangled up in some reasons that I think the book could be better.<br/><br/>So with all of that aside, now, in no particular order, here were some of my observations:<br/><br/>His argument that the Theory of Evolution disproves the existence of a soul is a flawed straw-man argument based on his definition of a soul as the root of the word ""individual."" While that origin is interesting, there is no reason that souls need be discrete and not a gradient thing, same as intelligence or creativity, and in fact this explanation would explain the relation of humans to animals anyways.<br/><br/>He never addresses the fact that science hasn't disproven the existence of the soul/spirit. He acts as if we haven't found it yet, therefore, it doesn't exist. <br/><br/>He doesn't discuss scientific bias, and in fact, completely whiffs on the fact that science is, itself, a religion (under his definition of religion used in this book, that classifies capitalism and liberalism and eugenics and big data-ism as religions). He briefly mentions that one could argue that science is a religion, and then says...nothing else about it at all. He just says essentially ""no it isn't"" and moves on. This was a huge wasted opportunity. It would have completely gone along with his theme to explore that dimension.<br/><br/>Large section are attack on religion while pretending to be something else. He classes branding, nationalism, and religions as ""fictions"" or ""intersubjective realities"" for they become real by humans believing collectively in them. He ignores that scientific theories are also fictions by this definition.<br/><br/>His definition of reality is humanist: whatever can cause people suffering. If we were being generous and assume by his examples that his real definition of reality is what can be experienced through human senses, then that's a little better, but not much. Many things have scientific evidence and can't be experienced. He also ignores any real investigation of evidence of the spiritual/supernatural.<br/><br/>He defines monotheists as those who believe that everything that happens to them is for spiritual reasons and claims that therefore all monotheists are childish. In fact he uses scripture as a source for this argument but never mentions that the entire book of Job is dedicated to debunking that every bad thing that happens to us is understandable and because we did something bad. This is a pattern I noticed throughout the book: he doesn't know his Old Testament as well as he thinks he does. Either that or he's cherry-picking intentionally, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>His explanation of the three camps of humanism and how they played out in 20th century history was useful. This feels like something I should have already known. Liberalism was challenged by two other humanisms: on the right, fascism (evolutionary humanism) and on the left, socialism (Marxist humanism). The great wars of the 1900s were actually religious wars between these three factions of the new world religion.<br/><br/>He's insightful that the masses (lower class) won't be necessary to leaders in the future as they were in the past, where leaders were incentivized to care for the source of their labor and armies.<br/><br/>Also, good insight that when algorithms understand individuals better than they do themselves, there's a natural step from recommending to you, to deciding for you: agency.<br/><br/>The last 5% or so of the book is his prediction of big data-ism: the worship of data. Yet he really only stubs out this idea. He presents what big data is doing to us and the philosophy (religion) that is emerging around it. But he doesn't take the time to ask: what does all of the data lead unto? Just more big data? This is circular thinking so there has to something more. Also, he claims that there is no other contender for the new world religion...really? Seems he could have explored other alternatives or at least attempted to show why big data is superior to others.<br/><br/>I don't disagree though that the big data religion is looming and in fact, some of the current events that he's mentioning can be expanded on greatly if you want to read [b:AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order|38242135|AI Superpowers  China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order|Kai-Fu Lee|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1521228712l/38242135._SX50_.jpg|59924665]. I highly recommend that for understanding the coming shift in the global economy (no it's not going to be like the automation shifts in the past), the advent of machine learning, what AI really is in different forms, and why it's going to be the US and China who will duke it out for supremacy of the new world battlefield: data.<br/><br/>How do I summarize Homo Deus? It seems impossible. I will only say that if you want to understand the present and future better, this is certainly worth reading, and as with anything should be examined and inspected and serve as a springboard to more reading. I appreciate the tremendous work that Harari has put into this and I hope that if he finds the time, he will expand on this even more in future editions.",,,1,0

Clarke,"Clarke, Arthur C.",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.17,Roc,Paperback,297,2000,1968,2020/11/03,2019/12/22,,,read,"This book covers a very grand, epic scope, starting with the dawn of man and then skipping ahead 3 million years to the present time (kind of. The time is ~33 yrs in the future of when this was written). There's a lot more in this book than I expected. It's kind of a compendium of most of the common/great sci-fi tropes/plots into one story. <br/><br/>As such, if you've been reading science fiction for a while, this will of course seem dated, in a couple ways. First, this was written as hard science fiction, and as such, lots of particulars have now proven totally wrong, such as many details about Jupiter and other planets/moons.  Second, because it is so concerned with explanations of minute details, and also because of the sheer amount of times it completely changes scope/time/place, there is little room left for much towards character development or very personal/interesting human factors that we normally look for in a story. There are two characters that have a bit of an arc, and one of these--arguably the more interesting--is actually an AI. The other is an astronaut whose reactions to things are rather normal and predictable, an everyman, if you will.<br/><br/>So those are the weaknesses of the story. Normally I would scorn a story so weak on character development and growth. Also this is not a literary work in terms of the prose or style, although there are a couple of beautiful moments. Nevertheless I found this work to be actually rather engaging and interesting. Why?<br/><br/>If you imagine the dawn of the space age (this was written one year before the first man set foot on the Moon in 1969), the context makes the story make sense. The attention to detail, explaining how so many things could work, makes more sense in a culture that was still trying to overcome its incredulity that man could ever reach into space. I can imagine the excitement of reading this and thinking, for the first time, yes: maybe man really can do it.<br/><br/>Second, so many of the science fiction tropes/plots that we know today probably stemmed from this work in the first place. This work is kind of like the books of myths written thousands of years ago, these stories with the bones of plots that would be used over and over and over again in literature because they are so powerful. This book is like such a book of myths in a microcosm specific to the arena of science fiction. I don't know enough about the history of science fiction to know how many of these were written for the first time in 2001 A Space Odyssey, but doubtless, simply compiling them into one early work in such a clear form is worthy of our attention.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful stories within this story is that of the AI, Hal. Spoiler ahead. This plot is a retelling of the story of Frankenstein: man makes a living thing, and that thing eventually turns against its maker. This is explored in a totally new way, but is still very powerful.<br/><br/>I will forego going into any more of the plot, and simply conclude by saying, I highly recommend any reader of science fiction to go back and read this classic. It will help you make sense of so much in the world of science fiction. It may not be as fast-paced as more modern sci-fi, or delve as deeply into characters. It is undoubtedly slow in parts. But if you engage your mind in terms of when this was written and what the first audience would have been experiencing, I think you will find it an enjoyable as well as elucidating travel. Bon voyage.",,,1,0

22034,"The Godfather (The Godfather, #1)",Mario Puzo,"Puzo, Mario","Robert Thompson, Peter Bart","=""""","=""""",4,4.40,NAL,Paperback,448,2002,1969,2020/10/19,2019/12/22,,,read,"When I discovered that one of my most beloved films of all time was based on a book, I was surprised, and then intrigued. I discovered that the director (Francis Ford Copolla) had worked closely with the writer (Mario Puzo), and this pleased me to know. <br/><br/>As I read (or rather, listened on audiobook, which I do recommend, as it has a very good narrator), I noticed all the little differences between the book and movie and concluded that they did not make one completely superior to the other. The differences struck me as largely there for good reasons. Things are simplified and condensed for the movie because the movie form needs to be even more powerful, evocative, and easy to understand without delving as much into inner thoughts of characters. In the book, there is more room to explore the back stories of many more characters, as well as room to look into inner motivations and thoughts more. The two works are both excellent in their own right, and while sometimes contradictory, not done so in flippant ways that would reveal a gross misunderstanding of the book.<br/><br/>At the beginning is an introduction by Copolla saying about Puzo, “I didn’t make him; he made me.” I admire this humility and honor that he paid to the man, and by the end of the book, I agreed with him.<br/><br/>What the book really adds (from the perspective of someone familiar with the film) is more character depth. There is a little more discussion of what the sons were like growing up and how they developed differently into their destinies. A mantra spoken by the Godfather throughout is that “every man has but one destiny,” and this is unfurled through the stories of his sons as well as a couple of other key characters whose rise is also unfolded more.<br/><br/>In the movies, the two hitmen that Michael uses to such devastating effect in the final act seem almost pulled out of nowhere. But in the books, both Rocco Lampone and Albert Neri have their own stories, explained succinctly, and their rise through the regime shown so that you understand how Michael came to acquire men of such talents.<br/><br/>Also explored in more depths are the stories of Johnny Fontaine, his friend Nino, Tom Hagan, Clemenza, Tessio, Luca Brasi, Carlo Rizzi, Connie, Kay, Kay’s father, mama Corleone, Jack Waltz, Captain McClusky, and others. Some of these characters are not even present in the films, or barely so. The result is a whole host of character’s stories in a full universe, a world even richer than the films.<br/><br/>Another aspect that makes it richer is a little more explanations of the thinking behind different key decisions, such as the recruitment of Al Neri and Rocco Lampone, as well as the Don’s thinking behind his appearing to be weaker while handing the reins over to Michael, his thinking on why and how to use out-of-control madmen like Luca, his thinking on how to say no, his thinking on so many things.<br/><br/>And that’s really where the jewels shine the most in the Godfather. Obviously the nuggets of wisdom to be obtained aren’t about how to kill people and extort and all that. The nuggets are about how to have friendships, how to take care of family, how to make yourself invaluable to others, how to handle people. Puzo said that the Italian people have the strongest family values of any culture, and those family values are what he considered to be the core of his story. I think that’s true. There is a lot of subtlety and variations on that theme, including many pitfalls openly displayed. It’s certainly not a naive telling, but rather a rich tapestry told with compassion as well as stark truth. There’s a lot to learn hear, and I’m sure I will be returning to this book many times throughout the years.<br/><br/>I should mention the one thing I didn’t like. There is gratuitous sex, moreso than in the movie, which I define as sex that does not significantly advance the characters and is told in more graphic detail than is useful or edifying—not that I think sex should never be discussed. At any rate, if you either don’t have the same feelings as me about sex, or are prepared to simply skip such sections, this does not have to be a major hurdle to enjoying the richness of the rest of the story.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the film many times, I would highly recommend reading this original book and discovering even more richness of characters and worldbuilding and wisdom than in the movies. You probably won’t regret it.",,,1,0

This is kind of like if Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy was made into a more traditional plotline/story about aliens invading Earth. There were a number of interesting ideas about telepathy, although sometimes it seems a bit silly what they can do with it, but all the same it's a very entertaining read that's not meant to be taken too seriously. I think it succeeds at doing what it was intended to do.<br/><br/>As far as this type of book goes, I think this one is pretty good. It uses some stereotypes and tropes, but it is self-aware of that fact oftentimes, and it's not nearly as bad as many much more tropish things I've read.<br/><br/>The pace is fast, the way most people like it, although for my personal taste I would have like it if it developed its themes and ideas more, into more extreme and varied circumstances. But that's just my taste.<br/><br/>Overall, I think a lot of people would like this. It's got a theme of humans having latent powers that come to life and how you rise up against a people group who enslave you.<br/><br/>The individuals in the group-of-friends-that-band-together have distinctive traits and characteristics that, while not completely original, are specific enough to give each of them a distinct flavor. Also, if listening on audio, their voices are all done well--not caricatures, but accurate and distinct enough to tell the difference.<br/><br/>It's also quite clean, so that's a bonus for people who appreciate that. There's not any sex, although there is a romantic plot, and the violence is not gory. There's even very minimal swearing; in fact that point is made into a recurring joke, as the main character was raised by a mother thought swearing was lazy and so made him be more specific. He stubs his toe and yells ""sexual intercourse"" or calls his friend an ""illegitimate son"" when he's mad, etc. I thought that added to the humor and enjoyment.",,,1,0

At first the story progresses as if it's a mystery to be solved. However as it goes along it becomes clear that there's fundamentally no mystery. A chronic, extreme alcoholic and mentally ill actor murders some people and claims that he was seeing iñukuns, and blames his crime on them. Wow, big mystery. Why do crazy people do the things they do? To have a successful mystery around why someone did something crazy, you would have to establish that they were definitely not crazy, whereas it is clear that Teddy is quite the alcoholic and definitely mentally ill.<br/><br/>After a while the story develops into more of a tragedy. In order to sell a tragedy, you have to convince us that the person was truly noble, and this shouldn't have happened. The narrator keeps trying to sell us that Teddy is charismatic, was a service to his community, and furthermore he's Native American, and the justice system is set up by the USA, so somehow this system is discriminatory against him. As if shooting people at point-blank range is somehow not murder in all cultures and for all people. While I'm certainly fine with viewing anyone as a human being with flaws, the narrator really goes too far trying to get us to see this character as actually noble.<br/><br/>And then there's the whole mystery of iñukuns. It's basically the same thing as all the people who claim they see Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. There's no evidence, in a day and age where everyone has a camera in their pocket. There's just stories told because it's fun. There is no story here. Unfortunately, the narrator seems to be naive and young. He believes anything and drops the f-bomb all the time as if that somehow makes everything more dramatic.<br/><br/>Because the story is so flawed, I can't give this more than 2 stars. However I do give it more than 1 because it does give you a sense of setting and culture, the audio quality is pretty good, and there are some good moments of suspense, particularly when he attacks the Buckels in the cabin. I would say that if a reader is interested in the topics of survival, Alaska, and Native Americans, then this could be worth reading once. Otherwise, I would not recommend.<br/><br/>Edit: one more thing. No, being sent to prison when you committed murder is not ""being colonized."" That's the consequences that everyone faces when they murder people. Honestly, who comes up with this drivel...",,,1,0

His insights are a bit lacking.<br/><br/>First off, this would better have been titled the Varieties of Christian Experiences, with a smattering of references to other religions. But I’ll put that point aside for the rest of the review and give him the benefit of the doubt that he was probably limited in how much he could delve into other religions (given the culture he was writing for at the time).<br/><br/>His basic premise in these lectures is to describe, from a psychologist’s perspective, the varieties of different people’s personal religious experiences, and try to understand them. He explains right off the bat that by dissecting them in such a way he is not at all trying to discredit their value or that they really happened. His first lecture I found to be very good as it explores the question of whether understanding the origins of events should contribute to how much we value or trust those events.<br/><br/>His methodology for picking examples to study is to pick the most extreme examples. He and I disagree—if that’s your only criteria then how are we filtering out the insane from the Godly? Nevertheless I read on and enjoyed learning about many of the different experiences people have had. This book of lectures is essentially a huge compendium of anecdotes, grouped by topic, with only a few chapters that are proper lectures on William James’ opinions on broad subjects, such as the chapter on philosophy toward the end. (This I considered to be probably the least useful chapter by far. I don’t think he knows what he is talking about at all re philosophy and he would have been better off not mentioning it.)<br/><br/>Overall I give this some stars for simply making available to me such a breadth of examples. This has piqued my interest on several notable figures and books that I will now go read.<br/><br/>However I found it lacking in two ways. The first is that, while with some of his claims he does back them up with good evidence, James also continually makes wide-sweeping claims unbacked by any evidence. He simply uses a word like “clearly” or “obviously” or “it should be apparent.” No, no, oftentimes it’s not in the least apparent—in my opinion at least. I recognize that not everyone will agree on what is apparent or not.<br/><br/>The second problem I have is with his manner of summarily dismissing entire areas of religion (such as mysticism or philosophy) or people. For example, he was extremely unfair to Mother Theresa in my opinion.<br/><br/>I also take some issue with him giving credence to some more extreme people who we cannot say are acting in good faith when they claim to be religious. Some examples of what I would include would be the sadomasochistic monks, a pirate who claims God helps him murder several people in Lecture 19, and especially the whole chapter devoted to the mind cure movement which is clearly a grouping of cults meant to take advantage of people.<br/><br/>The final lecture, which is supposed to be conclusions, rather baffled me. For the first half he talked on and on about topics that were seemingly unrelated and new topics not talked about during the rest of the lectures. But the second half did finally make an attempt to put together some concluding thoughts that were worthwhile but certainly not ground-breaking by any means.<br/><br/>An insight of his that I did find particularly compelling is that we interact with the supernatural through our subconscious. There is considerable evidence that he cites to back this up and for me personally that idea illuminated many of my own experiences.<br/><br/>I didn’t end this series of lectures feeling quite satisfied, but I am glad that I have been made aware of some areas of spirituality that I was unaware of, and it has given me further reading recommendations. So for those reasons it was worth reading.",,,1,0

The old ways include paying tribute to all the Domovoy, or household gods of the people.  I think of them more as nymphs than ""household god"" in the same way that ancient near eastern cultures had.  The new ways are russian orthodox christianity, and the main premise of the book is that the priest who comes to town and makes the people stop paying tribute to the Domovoy is actually destroying the fabric of their society because that weakens the Domovoy and then they cannot keep out the dark forces that seek to destroy men's lives.<br/><br/>Outside of the Domovoy, there are also two very important figureheads for the forces of order and the forces of chaos that have been warring with each other for millenia, one side for man and the other side against it.  I found the aspects of these figureheads to be pretty interesting as well; kind of a different take on explaining, mythologically, how life works.  I found this aspect of the mythology also very thought-provoking.  I won't say more details about them here for the sake of not spoiling anything because I think it's better to discover who they really are as you go along reading it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed learning a lot about the Domovoy and other aspects of Russian lore.  But by the end of the book I was tired of the one-sidedness of the old culture vs the new.  No one representing the new religion have any redeemable aspects--they are just all terrible, terrible people.  This kind of villain is uninteresting to me.<br/><br/>The heroine is unapologetically feminist, choosing her own path even though everyone around her tries to force her to either marry or go to a convent.  This I enjoyed.<br/><br/>There were a few things that happen towards the end that are disturbing to me.  I won't enumerate those because that would really spoil some very important plot details.<br/><br/>Overall...it's well-written, it's a good glimpse of Russian culture for the uninitiated, it's easy to read, and it has a pretty good protagonist.  But the villains are not quite believable and there are a few disturbing things that don't jive with me.  So I would rate this as a good book, and not one I regret reading, but still not one that I'm quite excited about.  I would recommend it if you want to learn a good dose of Russian lore in a palatable format.",,,1,0
